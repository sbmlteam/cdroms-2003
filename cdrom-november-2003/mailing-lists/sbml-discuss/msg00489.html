Hi Maria,

Thanks for your response!


Ok, I think the term 'hybrid' is somewhat ambiguously defined here, and it points to
several different concepts:  

- Mixed-mode -- some simulators like SPICE uses this term to mention 
                          continuous/discrete (analog/digital) 'hybrid' scheme of simulation

- Multi-algorithm -- In my thesis I define this term to mean that multiple sub-models driven
                             by different simulation algorithms can coexist.
                             E-Cell is a multi-algorithm simulator, and I don't call it hybrid.
                             It is a 'composite' scheme, because there is modularity.
                             Hybrid usually means to put some different thing/entity into one single new 
                             thing/entity.

                             As far as I know, E-Cell is the only software that support this
                             type of multi-algorithm simulations in systems biology and biochemical
                             simulators.      There must be some if I don't limit to biological simulators,
                             but I just don't know.

                             I call Zeigler's 'combined-formalism' approach as hybrid 
                             multi-algorithm framework,  and his 
                             'embedded-formalism' approach as more like a 'composite' scheme.

- Other 'hybrid's --  For example, combining dynamic rate equation-based model with
                              static FDA (flux distribution analysis) calculations.   Some people
                              in our lab. is working on this, and they call it 'hybrid algorithm'
                              Or, combining spatial and non-spatial models, or whatever.
                              There are many possibilities.



&gt; At the last Forum meeting in Ft Lauderdale, Takeshi mentioned that you
&gt; E-cell people have your own markup language to describe models for
&gt; E-cell (EML). Is EML capable of describing hybrid models?

Well EML is much more simpler than SBML, and intended as means of object-persistence
of E-Cell's simulation model.    So it is a low-level language (like VCML?).   

So understand E-Cell's object model, and you get what's EML is.
I have described a bit on this in my previous message to sbml-discuss:

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Hi all,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have a book in front of me called "Theory of Modeling and 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Simulation" 2nd ed., by Zeigler, Praehofer &amp; Kim. I remember 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; listening to a talk on E-cell (can't remember whether it 
&gt; &gt; was given 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by Takeshi), in which this book was cited as the 'basis' 
&gt; &gt; for E-cell 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - is that so, Takeshi?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I think that was me -- I gave a short talk in the SBML 
&gt; &gt; meeting at your unversity.  (herts.ac.uk).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; As Takeshi wrote for me, E-Cell Version 3's fundamental 
&gt; &gt; algorithm is inspired by
&gt; &gt; Zeigler's rigid theory of discrete event simulation.    
&gt; &gt; However, the approach is
&gt; &gt; very different actually.   It's basically unique, except that 
&gt; &gt; I borrowed some fundamental 
&gt; &gt; concepts from Zeigler's theory.     Such as:  (1) the fact 
&gt; &gt; that it can be mathematically
&gt; &gt; proven that any time driven simulation algorithms can be 
&gt; &gt; mixed in the framework of discrete event, (2) discrete-event 
&gt; &gt; scheduling method, and (3), hi classification of simulation 
&gt; &gt; algorithms (see below).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Actually I'm now writing my phd thesis on this :)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Zeigler proposed two different ways to combine different 
&gt; &gt; formalisms:  combining and
&gt; &gt; embedding.   The former means that it is possible to 
&gt; &gt; 'combine' two different algorithms
&gt; &gt; into one more powerful one (such as Zeigler's DEVS&amp;DESS).    
&gt; &gt; E-Cell's algorithm
&gt; &gt; is different, and may be classified into the latter category, 
&gt; &gt; in which each different
&gt; &gt; algorithm is embedded in the 'discrete-event world view' as a 
&gt; &gt; module.   
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; One design goal of my algorithm, which I believe is one good 
&gt; &gt; characteristic of my work, is to keep orthogonality between 
&gt; &gt; algorithm modules: which means that existing simulation 
&gt; &gt; algorithms (such as Gillespie, ODE solvers, automata,
&gt; &gt; and anything) can be used with no or a little modification.     
&gt; &gt; I think this is very important because we already have many 
&gt; &gt; simulation algorithms
&gt; &gt; and many partial models of cellular systems on those 
&gt; &gt; algorithms.   A big challenge for
&gt; &gt; a simulator developer now is how to combine these existing 
&gt; &gt; sub-models to construct a higher-order models (such as a 
&gt; &gt; whole-cell scale simulation).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To get back to your email, Ed, Zeigler et al. distinguish 3 types
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (formalisms) of dynamic model specification (as opposed to e.g. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; object modelling, in which there is no concept of time): the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Discrete Time (DTSS), Differential Equation (DESS), and Discrete 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Event (DEVS) System Specifications. DESS includes ODE and PDE 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; descriptions. DTSS includes things such as cellular 
&gt; &gt; automata (which 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are updated as a whole in a unit 'time' step).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; This is one thing I borrowed from his theory.  
&gt; &gt; E-Cell provides three fundamental 'Stepper' classes, 
&gt; &gt; DiscreteTimeStepper, DifferentialStepper, and DiscreteEventStepper.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I think (but I'm not entirely sure) that DEVS includes
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stochastic models (in which possible state transitions 
&gt; &gt; have certain 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; probabilities), but also threshold models (in which a state 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; transition occurs when a certain parameter crosses a given 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; threshold). Have I understood this correctly?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; DEVS include stochastic models, but DTS and DES can also be 
&gt; &gt; stochastic.   
&gt; &gt; (stochastic automata and stochastic differential equations)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Gillespie's family of algorithms is one good example of 
&gt; &gt; discrete-event simulation framework.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; We have tried to use E-Cell to do composite simulation of 
&gt; &gt; Gillespie-Gibson and ODE 
&gt; &gt; (we used Dormand-Prince 4(5)7M algorithm), and we found that
&gt; &gt; it can improve the performance 600+ times in our case.  
&gt; &gt; Actually it exceeds both pure-Gillespie and pure-ODE runs.   
&gt; &gt; We are also trying some other combinations.  
&gt; &gt; For example, we have a long-term depression model of a neuron 
&gt; &gt; which has a discrete-time and an ODE sub-models.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; -Kouichi
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; P.S.  
&gt; &gt; If you are interested, more detailed description of E-Cell's 
&gt; &gt; algorithm is available upon request. 
&gt; &gt; Sorry, it is still an unpublished work.
