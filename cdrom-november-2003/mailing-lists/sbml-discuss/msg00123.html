I would contend there is some experience about using MathML "in the wild"
from a development perspective.  It's about the same as any reasonably
facile, prefix based syntax for expressions, namely significant, but
much simpler than infix expressions with the same expressiveness.

What would you propose using instead of MathML for expressions?
Simple expression syntaxes have a way of evolving into not-so-simple,
customized, expression syntaxes and these are always more difficult
to maintain because they require a more specialized body of knowledge
about the implementation.

Marc Vass may also want to comment on his experience building a level
2 compatible processor and the impact MathML has on its complexity.

&gt; I may not agree with the explicit and mandatory specification of the unit
&gt; volume compartment in all models (although I abide by the community
&gt; decision) I do agree with Pedro's sentiments with respect to letting these
&gt; standards live a life first in the real world before they get cast into
&gt; stone. For example, let's see how the use of MathML in Level 2 turns out, it
&gt; may or may not be the best route to take, we don't actually know how it will
&gt; turn out since none of us have tried to use it in the wild (so to speak).
&gt; Perhaps MathML might turn out too be expensive to support in terms of
&gt; programming cost, both development and maintenance. I know Ben is writing a
&gt; MathML reader/writer, but once he has gone who maintains it, it's not as if
&gt; we have a vibrant open-source comp bio community which contributes code or
&gt; modifies existing code, quite the opposite in fact.
&gt;
&gt; There are still issues in level 1 that haven't been resolved and at the
&gt; moment we're managing to get models portable between tools because the
&gt; authors of the tools have agreed to use Level 1 in a certain way which may
&gt; or may not follow the strict guidelines in the level 1 document.
&gt;
&gt; I am aware however of the urgency in setting the standard, I know there are
&gt; many pressures to get the standard out asap.

&gt;
&gt; Mike &amp; Andrew,
&gt;
&gt; I support the analysis you made and therefore the conclusion.
&gt;
&gt; This discussion brings up an issue that has been dormant (but here!) since
&gt; the
&gt; freeze of level 1 version 1: the need for a longer period of time between
&gt; deciding on features and actually freezing (publishing) the specification.
&gt; When
&gt; I and Herbert were working on making existing software import/export SBML
&gt; level
&gt; 1 we discovered a number of features that could have been decided in a
&gt; better
&gt; way, and others that were missing. While you made a very good analysis of
&gt; the
&gt; problem of default compartments, it is easy to miss out important
&gt; consequences
&gt; from such analyses. I propose that the next specs be accepted first as draft
&gt;
&gt; for a considerable period of time (say 1 year), and then adjusted according
&gt; to
&gt; feedback from those who have been implementing for the draft. It would also
&gt; be
&gt; important to publish reference software that demonstrates use of the
&gt; standard.
&gt; This procedure would ensure that we iron out problems with the standards.
&gt; Given
&gt; that we already have a standard for the most common features of models, we
&gt; should be careful to get the standard right for the features that are only
&gt; now
&gt; being thought of (ie most simulators do not implement them yet, in some
&gt; cases
&gt; none)
