<PRE>
     At the recent SBML Forum I ended up volunteering to be the person to
email the general announcement regarding formation of the SBML Spatial
Features working group, since one of the models we are concerned with (the
4D Chromosome folding model) deals with spatial features (and time courses)  
exclusively with no use if I understand it correctly of reaction lists.

     I did not volunteer to chair or co-chair this group, so the first
order of business is for someone with broader interests in this area to
step forward to chair the group and put together a better charter than I
would be able to compose.  I gather from the presentations made at the
Spatial Modeling breakout session in the subsequent BioSPICE meeting that
there are modelers who work with reaction lists who wish to consider
spatial issues in describing some reactions.  When I asked about how much
interest they had in distance limits between pairs of species, which is
central to our needs, that sounded pretty peripheral to their main
interests.  I believe the chief overlap between their spatial concerns and
ours is the ability we both would use to designate the XYZ coordinates of
a species (in time and space).

     I imagine our interest in distance bounds in our 4D Chromosome
folding model will likely be addressed most effectively in the Constraints
working group, but we will also have interest in methods for representing
locations of species that are likely to be developed in the context of
the spatial features working group.

     The people who signed up for the Spatial Features group at the SBML
Forum are

    Greg Peterson 	gdp@utk.edu
    Mike McCollum	jmccoll2@utk.edu
    Daniel Lucio	lucio@adp.uchc.edu
    Akira Funahashi	funa@symbio.jst.go.jp
    Takeshi Sakurada	sakurada@sfc.keio.ac.jp
    Jim Schaff		schaff@neuron.uchc.edu
    Steve Burbeck	sburbeck@us.ibm.com
    Michael Hucka	mhucka@caltech.edu
    Poul Nielsen	p.nielsen@auckland.ac.nz
    Vijay Saraswat	saraswat@cse.psu.edu
    Wayne Rindone	wrindone@arep.med.harvard.edu
    John Wagner		jwagner@nso.uchc.edu

    In addition, I hope that the two people who presented their interests
in representing models with spatial features at the BioSPICE meeting
breakout meeting on that topic will be interested in participate in
helping the SBML community in designing how to represent such features. 
They are welcome to indicate their interest in this working group by an
email to sbml-discuss@caltech.edu (likewise anyone else not already listed
above who wishes to participate).  A similar email from someone willing to
chair this group, whether already listed or not, would also be most
welcome.

     The two BioSPICE folk who made presentations at the Spatial Features
breakout were

     Andrzej Przekwas		ajp@cfdrc.com
     Phil Colella		PColella@lbl.gov

     I will be happy to participate in forming this group and in its
discussions, but I should let people know that between June 24 and July 9
I will be traveling in Sweden, visiting friends and relatives, and will
only have minimal sporadic access to reading or responding to email.
