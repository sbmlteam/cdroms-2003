Yes indeed, I forgot about rounded squares, that should be included. As for
the residues sites I'm not sure what to do about that, I saw your document
on this and it's look good, in fact I should look at it again as I've
probably missed out a couple of shapes. The residue sites brings up a number
of issues which we should consider, how do we represent complex composite
shapes, eg a gene/promoter figures, or Hiroaki's residue sites?

Maybe we'll have to reconsider SVG after all, unless we can devise some
means of specifying composite shapes built from our basic shapes which I'm
sure we could. With composite sites another issues comes up, where should
reaction/interaction arrows end up when they approach a node? Shold they
point to the center of a node, or some particular aspect of a node shape, eg
a residue site on the node, or the promoter site on a gene shape? Lots of
issues to consider!

In CellDesigner, we use Square with round corners to represent protein.
and put small circles on it to represent specific residue site.

Hiroaki


&gt; 
&gt; Here's an initial list of predefined shapes that might be useful:
&gt; 
&gt; Square (includes rectangle)
&gt; Circle (include ellipse)
&gt; Triangle
&gt; Pentagon
&gt; Hexagon
&gt; Parallelogram
&gt; Rhombus (rotated square?)
&gt; Heptagon
&gt; Octagon
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Plus any others not included but people would like.
&gt; 
&gt; If these do end up in the spec we should also indicate algorithms in
the
&gt; spec doc (in some code perhaps) on how to draw these.

&gt; 
&gt; Noted. We should make sure and predefine
&gt; plenty of such shapes, as well as maybe
&gt; allow user-defined shapes that are reusable:
&gt; &lt;view&gt;
&gt; &lt;listOfShapes&gt;
&gt; &lt;shape name="Shape1" ...&gt;
&gt; &lt;shape name="Shape2" ...&gt;
&gt; &lt;/listOfShapes&gt;
&gt; &lt;diagram w="10" h="10" ...&gt;
&gt; &lt;glyph species="CytosolicCalcium" x="7" y="5" w="1"
&gt; h="2" shape="Shape1"&gt;
&gt; &lt;glyph species="CytosolicSodium" x="4" y="3" w="2" h="1"
&gt; shape="Shape2"&gt;
&gt; &lt;glyph species="CytosolicPotassium" x="4" y="3"
&gt; shape="PredefinedTriangle"&gt;
&gt; &lt;/diagram&gt;
&gt; &lt;/view&gt;

&gt; &gt; One thing I didn't like about SVG was the lack of support for 
&gt; &gt; predefined
&gt; &gt; shapes such as triangles, hexagons etc. I know one can 
&gt; &gt; specify then using
&gt; &gt; straight coordinates but ....

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; As I said, I had only looked at it recently,
&gt; &gt; but at the time I wasn't really thinking about
&gt; &gt; using SVG in its entirety, just maybe borrowing
&gt; &gt; pieces of it. SVG is a spec for painting vector-
&gt; &gt; based graphics, whereas what we want is something
&gt; &gt; that tells us how to lay out our pathways--far
&gt; &gt; less difficult, and much more specific.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Some of its constructs, however, could be
&gt; &gt; useful. For example, how it specifies colors,
&gt; &gt; shapes, lines/curves could be used to our
&gt; &gt; purposes. For example, I kind of like their
&gt; &gt; &lt;defs&gt;...&lt;/defs&gt;, something *like* that could
&gt; &gt; be useful for defining standard shapes/elements.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; As to my first point, about lots of optional
&gt; &gt; detail...my idea is that we allow tools to
&gt; &gt; export a fairly detailed description of their
&gt; &gt; diagram(s), and, upon importing a model, they
&gt; &gt; can simply ignore anything they don't want to
&gt; &gt; (or can't) deal with. For example, the Virtual
&gt; &gt; Cell will export many, many diagrams, all but
&gt; &gt; one of which JDesigner will iggy. When JDesigner
&gt; &gt; exports a layout, it might specify that species
&gt; &gt; are to be drawn as red rectangles with black
&gt; &gt; borders; the Virtual Cell, when it imports that
&gt; &gt; layout, will say, "Herbert wanted red rects with
&gt; &gt; black borders...bummer...looks like little yellow
&gt; &gt; circles it is". This fits with the idea of allow-
&gt; &gt; ing a very fine level of detail in the diagrams.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Best example is the size thing: let's allow a
&gt; &gt; size to be specified, and any tool that doesn't
&gt; &gt; have a size-based approach can simply iggy it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I can live with SVG so long as someone is willing to write 
&gt; &gt; &gt; the parser for it
&gt; &gt; &gt; (portable C please), it's not pure XML so it might be some 
&gt; &gt; work at the
&gt; &gt; &gt; software end.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [sbml-discuss] DWG preliminary issues
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; First, it looks like we are not going to use the forum.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Several members expressed that they'd much prefer
&gt; &gt; &gt; to use email. (That's why I didn't reply to your email
&gt; &gt; &gt; earlier, Pedro.)
&gt; &gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; &gt; That said, without an indexing by working group
&gt; &gt; &gt; and topic, this is pretty unworkable, especially
&gt; &gt; &gt; given the tremendous volume of discussion now
&gt; &gt; &gt; and, most likely, in the future; 39 of my last 50
&gt; &gt; &gt; email messages have been sbml-discuss--and I
&gt; &gt; &gt; have purposefully not sent any DWG messages
&gt; &gt; &gt; out. What a complete pain in the ass.
&gt; &gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; &gt; Now, for the preliminary issues:
&gt; &gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. It appears that some groups want a LOT of
&gt; &gt; &gt; flexibility in diagrams, others want very little.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Can we all agree on the general approach of
&gt; &gt; &gt; "lots of optional details"? 
&gt; &gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. A number of people have suggested SVG
&gt; &gt; &gt; might be a viable approach. I hadn't read up
&gt; &gt; &gt; on it until recently, but now that I have, I can
&gt; &gt; &gt; see some distinct advantages. What is everyone's
&gt; &gt; &gt; initial view on this: do you think SVG would
&gt; &gt; &gt; be a good/viable approach, or would it be
&gt; &gt; &gt; too much of a pain in the butt for people to
&gt; &gt; &gt; jump on board?
