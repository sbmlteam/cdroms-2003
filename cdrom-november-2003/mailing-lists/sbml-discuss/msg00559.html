hello,

&gt; 0. With a few exceptions, SBML does not use abbreviations.
&gt; Abbreviations are a Bad Idea, because they rarely make sense
&gt; to anyone but the person who thought them up in the first
&gt; place. So, I would change the "GR" and "GRs" to something
&gt; more intuitive; I like "Glyph" and "Glyphs".
&gt; 1. In SBML, things like reactants and products, in referencing
&gt; other things like species, use an attribute name that is specific
&gt; to their context. For example, a speciesReference element has
&gt; a "species" attribute to refer to a species. The layout markup
&gt; should follow this approach. Specifically:
&gt; 	* &lt;compartmentGR id="cGR1" compartment="c1" ... /&gt;
&gt; 	* &lt;speciesGR id="sGR1" species="s1" ... /&gt;
&gt; 	* &lt;reactionGR id="rGR1" reaction="r1" ... /&gt;
&gt; 	* &lt;speciesReferenceGR id="sRGR1" speciesGR="sGR1" ... /&gt;
&gt; Consistency begets clarity, beauty, and all sorts of other
&gt; wonderful nouns.

Since our proposal is only a suggestion, certainly the names can be changed. 
Especially your second remark makes sense to me.

&gt; 2. The whole "role" stuff in speciesReferenceGR elements seems
&gt; a bit vague and misplaced to me, and unless someone can explain
&gt; how a graphical representation has a "role" in another graphical
&gt; representation (as is suggested by their verbiage)--especially
&gt; given roles like "product" or "substrate", which are chemical
&gt; roles rather than visual, graphical representation roles--I
&gt; would like to see this overhauled. That is, these are either
&gt; visual entities, or they are chemistry. If they are visual
&gt; entities, then the attribute names (and roles themselves)
&gt; should be given names reflecting this. If they are chemistry,
&gt; then they should be moved to model section; in that case, my
&gt; initial reaction would be to make speciesReferenceGR elements
&gt; specifically reference the speciesReference that they are
&gt; visually representing, and then put the role info in the
&gt; speciesReference elements. IN ANY CASE, a lot of the "role"
&gt; stuff seems incredibly redundant and vague, and belongs
&gt; (and indeed, already exists) elsewhere.

Let me explain why we did it like this:
Our reaction glyph (as you would propably like to call it) consists basically 
of 2 nodes representing the points where the substrate arcs and the product 
arcs meet (additional information of how to connect these 2 nodes could be 
added). Then the reaction glyph contains species reference glyphs (graphical 
representations of species references in our proposal). These species 
reference glyphs contain the information which species glyphs are connected 
to which node of the reaction glyph and how the arc looks like.
The whole mess with the roles comes from the fact that we need to reference a 
specific species reference in the species reference glyph (Because if we want 
to have a graphical model editor it should be possible to click on an arc and 
then know which species reference it refers to). Since species references do 
not have an ID we refer to them by reaction, species, and role. And even that 
is still potentially ambiguous. So the first role ("refRole" in our proposal) 
is used to refer to a species reference in the model. The second role ("role" 
in our proposal) is used to tell a renderer with some biochemical knowhow how 
to render the connection between species glyph and the nodes of the reaction 
glyph. Propbably some renderers would draw a species reference glyph with 
"substrate" role as some arc connecting the species glyph to the substrate 
node of the reaction glyph. 

The reason why this two roles can differ was given in the discussion on this 
mailing list some time ago: Say we want to render a reaction A-&gt;B catalized 
by enzyme E (this reaction has three species references) as A+E-&gt;B+E (four 
species reference glyphs). In this case we have two species reference glyphs 
(with role "substrate" and "product") that refer to one species reference (a 
modifier species reference)

The underlying assumption for our proposal is of course that the layout 
description does not only focus on the graphics (in this case we should use a 
general graph description language) but on the biochemical structure of the 
layout. 

What we want to carry with a species reference glyph would be in English:
"Species glyph x is connected to Reaction y as a substrate. The species 
reference it refers to is z. If you want to know more there is additional 
information on how to render the arc."

We do not want to carry information like: "There are nodes x,y,z, and they are 
connected by arcs a,b,c, and we have information how to render the arcs"
