 1st SBML Hackathon July 29-30, 2003
    VBI Blacksburg, Virginia, USA

(Please see previous announcement from Stefan Hoops.)

We are in the process of planning for the Hackathon
this month.  We would like to co-ordinate some discussion
of what the community would like to do at this event
in advance to maximize its benefits.  Ideally we
would like to minimize the time spent at the meeting
itself organizing the agenda/priorities/procedures
and maximize the hands-on technical aspects of the meeting.

So first we'd like to ask you what you'd like to see 
happen at this meeting.

Does the following seem reasonable?

The aim of the 1st Hackathon will be to evaluate and 
improve the interoperability of Systems Biology software
through the use of SBML Levels 1 and 2.  This will involve
the live testing of SBML file interchange of participants'
software combined with software adjustment (hacking) 
to fix interoperability defects where possible.
An expected outcome of the meeting will be the
prioritization of SBML standard developments and SBML
parser library development.  The meeting will involve the
exchange of both Level 1 and Level 2 models; however,
we strongly encourage developers to implement support 
for level 2 by this meeting.

The participants are asked to bring to the meeting
one or more models in SBML with humanly readable
documentation describing these models, this will include
simulation output where appropriate. This documentation
would ideally be a journal paper but other forms like
simple text dumps of the complete model and diagrams
would be more than acceptable.  It is expected that
the supplied SBML models will be revised during the
course of the meeting.

During the meeting participants will attempt to read
in the models generated by the tools authored by
other groups and to reproduce the simulation results.
Where inconsistencies occur between tools, participants
will attempt to fix either model generation and parsing
components on the spot or after 
the meeting.

VBI will provide a local file server, accessible via
either scp or Wiki interfaces, for the storage of models
during the meeting which will be accessible from
participants machines when connected to the VBI LAN.
If you have specific hardware, software or networking
requirements please let Stefan Hoops know well in
advance. Please supply your Wireless MAC address when
you register if you have one.

We will make available an executable, based on
Ben Bornstein's SBML L2 parser library, capable of
translating models between Level 1 and 2.

Please let us know if you would tutorials on
any of the following subjects:

- SBML best practice
- Ben Bornstein's SBML L1 and L2 C/C++ parser library
- Marc Vass' SBML L2 Java parser library

Are you unable to attend the meeting but would like to
have your software evaluated in your absence?

If you have other ideas or expectations please let us know.

yours

Andrew Finney, Mike Hucka, Pedro Mendes, Stefan Hoops
