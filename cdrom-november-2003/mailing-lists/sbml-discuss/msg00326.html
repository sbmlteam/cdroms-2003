Since discussions have come several times to the points that different 
model use different parts of SBML, I would like to present the start of 
a discussion about specifying which parts and which assumptions are 
used. below please find my first start of a document which is also 
attached as PDF. This discussion should be handled in the "Controlled 
vocabularies" subgroup that was planned at the florida meeting, and for 
which Mike wanted to initiate discussion (probably he wants to start 
when other things have wuieted down a bit, which I can understand). I 
post this now to make others aware of the discussion we had in Florida, 
where Cliff Shaffer and I myself ageed on the strong need for such a 
specification.

1   Introduction

This is a proposal for a recommendation on the usage of a controlled
vocabulary for the desctiption of tools and models using the systems
biology markup language (SBML).

    Different tools for handling SBML files have different capabilities 
of which constructs in SBML they support. A controlled way of specifying 
these capabilities is needed to find out if a tool can handle a certain 
model or class of models. Conversely, models could specify which 
capabilities they need. Apart from capabilities, specifications on the 
assumptions that a tool makes are also necessary.

    A set of filters could be developed to overcome some limitations of
certain tools. Such a filter would need to know the capabilities of the
target tool. An automatic tool could be written to find out which SBML
features are used in a model.  This tool could also try to make some
inferences about the assumptions, but cannot necessarily resolve all
assumptions.

2   List of features

A preliminary list of features of SBML that tools might or might not
support follows:

2.1   SBML level 1

    o Level 1 Version 1
    o Level 1 Version 2
    o Level 1 Version 3
    o rules
    o scalar AssigmentRules
    o rate AssigmentRules
    o AlgebraicRule
    o KineticRateLaw
    o Formulas
    o only Mass Action
    o predefined math functions
    o predefined rate law functions
    o local Parameters
    o global Parameters
    o Units
    o Compartment volume not 1


2.2   SBML level 2

Additional features in SBML level 2:

    o Level 2
    o Level 2 Version 1
    o Level 2 Version 2
    o Level 2 Version 3
    o Level 2 minus MathML
    o logical operators in MathML
    o function definition
    o ModifierSpeciesReference
    o Delays
    o Events
    o Names (in addition to IDs)
    o initial concentration

2.3   SBML level 3

Additional features in SBML level 3:

    o submodels
    o Instances
    o Arrays
    o Sparse arrays
    o dynamic arrays
    o Parameter sets
    o initialAssigmentRule
    o Ports
    o Links to Ports only

2.4   Notes and annotations

    o XHTML notes
    o Graph layout annotation
    o ....

    The above list of features is necessarily incomplete. Some features
could be structured hierarchically, some are mutually exclusive, and
especially regarding notes and annotations, extension to other features
will be necessary.

3   Properties of tools regarding the features


Looking at the list of features, we can try to find how those words 
could be used in describing a tool or a model.


3.1   Models

For models, one could state that

                         This model uses &lt;feature&gt;.
or
                      This model does not use &lt;feature&gt;.
and
               This model is created with assumption &lt;feature&gt;.


3.2   Tools


The most important properties for tools are whether a tool can read SBML
files and whether the models written by the tool contain (or can contain) a
feature. Example sentences would be


      This tool can correctly read and process models that use &lt;feature&gt;.

               This tool cannot read models that use &lt;feature&gt;.

             This tool creates models that may contain &lt;feature&gt;.

           The models that this tool creates never contain &lt;feature&gt;.

      This tool can optionally create all models without using &lt;feature&gt;.

This tool can convert models with &lt;feature&gt; into models without &lt;feature&gt;.


4   Formalizing


It is desirable to create a vocabulary in which features and properties 
are orthogonal, in that each feature can be combined with each property 
and the statement would make sense.
    An example list of properties would be: "Never" "Read only",
"Read and Write", "Used", "Not used".
    A capability of a tool is then a pair of feature and property.  This
could be formalized as am xml schema, such that the capabilities of a 
model could be described by the following XML fragment inside an 
annotation node of the SBML file:

&lt;annotation xmlns:cap="<A  HREF="http://www.sbml.org/2002/ns/capabilities/">http://www.sbml.org/2002/ns/capabilities/</A>&gt;
   &lt;/cap:capability cap:feature="Delays" cap:property="Not used"&gt;
   &lt;/cap:capability cap:feature="Events" cap:property="Used"&gt;
&lt;/annotation&gt;


4.1   RDF


The information about models is a typical example of metadata.  Therefore
one should investigate whether the Resource Description Format (RDF) can
approriately be used for formalizing the capabilities.
