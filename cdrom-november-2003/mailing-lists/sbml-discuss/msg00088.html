Thanks for your enquiry I will try to answer your questions

My reply may raise a number if issues that people may wish to discuss
with respect to the standard

I think you have run into a possible confusion with the standard
which is I think understandable.

a) although the initialAmount attribute for a species is in substance
units
(either moles or number of molecules - default moles).  The identifier
for
the species in the kinetic rate law (and other expressions) represents
the
concentration of the species (substance/volume units)

- Why isn't initialAmount concentration (substance/volume)?
	People often need to able to specify species amount in number of
molecules.
	Number of molecules isn't translatable into concentration but
into units of substance

(SBML allows the units for substance and volume to be globally
redefined.)

b) A kinetic law in SBML returns the rate of change of substance
and not concentration.  see rationale below

c) The identifier for a compartment e.g. compA can be used in an
expression
to represent the volume of the compartment i.e. you don't need
the .volume qualifier.

Folks if you don't like any of this let us know!
Feel free to comment on how this may or may not conflict with how
you import or export SBML.

Explanation of item (b)  

( below a symbol
	e.g. A represents the substance of a species and
		[A] represents the concentration of a species)

In both L1 and L2 the formula used to 
define the rate of a given reaction is defined
to be amount/time (moles/second by default).
This is reasonable since reactions change
species amount directly and only species 
concentration indirectly.  
 
We are aware that many modelers use 
concentration/time or amount/volume/time
(moles/liter/second by default) when 
defining rate of change formulae
for species.  Thus we defined
speciesConcentration rules that have these
units.

So at first this may seem to be inconsistent both
within SBML and perhaps with the approach of the
modeling community.

However there is a reason for this:

a) Kinetic laws on reactions don't define the
rate of change of a single species. In fact
the rate of change of species is composed 
from the rate laws of all reactions in which
the species is either a reactant or product.
The result is a formula that defines a rate of
change of amount for the species.

b) A reaction can have a transport component
i.e. move species from one compartment to another
where each compartment can have a different volume.

Consider the situation where there are 3 species A, B and
C all in separate compartments with volumes Va, Vb, and Vc
respectively.  We define a transporting reaction A -&gt; B + C
with a rate law k[A]  

the rates of change of amount are 

A' = -k[A]
B' = k[A]
C' = k[A]

and thus the rates of change of concentration are:

[A]' = -k[A]/Va
[B]' = k[A]/Vb
[C]' = k[A]/Vc

One immediate observation of this is if you
don't care about volume and compartments:
you just locate everything inside a single unit 
compartment and then [A] = A thus returning the
math to the conventional representation.

Lets consider a definition of rate laws that
might seem rational: the rate law defines the rate of 
change of concentration of the species in the reaction.
Thus we have

[A]' = -k[A]
[B]' = k[A]
[C]' = k[A]

therefore the rates of change of amount are

A' = -k[A]Va
B' = k[A]Vb
C' = k[A]Vc

Hopefully you'd agree that this is incorrect:
this suggests that you can increase the rate of increate
of amount of C simply by increasing the volume of C's compartment.

&gt; Subject: Re: [sbml-discuss] SBML: Concentration vs. Quantity 
&gt; in SBML Level 1
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; SBML provides the posibility of defining compartments and specify 
&gt; volumes. Species provisions are made for rules that change 
&gt; the volumes. 
&gt; If a model uses volumes that change in time and second order 
&gt; reactions 
&gt; appear in the model, it is not possible to ensure that your units are 
&gt; compatible, no matter whether you have a PhD or not. You need 
&gt; the volume 
&gt; to convert between quantities of molecules and concentrations, or you 
&gt; need a modelling tool that is able to do this for you.
&gt; 
&gt; I read somewhere (this might be out of date), that Jarnac assumes a 
&gt; single compartment with unit volume (constant in time), so 
&gt; for this tool 
&gt; the issue does not appear. Changing volumes can still be modeled, but 
&gt; then the volume would be a separate variable that would 
&gt; probably appear 
&gt; in SBML as a substance.
&gt; 
&gt; JDesigner does allow the creation of compartments, and 
&gt; specification of 
&gt; their volume, though how they are used is unclear to me ( I 
&gt; am working 
&gt; on linux and have not installed JDesigner).
&gt; 
&gt; An example of the complications that appear even with fixed 
&gt; volumes is 
&gt; the following:
&gt; 
&gt; Imagine two compartments with different volumes and a 
&gt; transport process 
&gt; between the two. Transporting one molecule between the two 
&gt; compartments 
&gt; has a different effect on the concentrations in the two 
&gt; volumes: in the 
&gt; smaller volume the change in concentration is proportionally 
&gt; larger. So 
&gt; where does this information go?
&gt; Does the user have to include the conversion between molecule numbers 
&gt; and concentrations in the kineticLaw formula?
&gt; 
&gt; I have appended an SBML example file, which does not include the 
&gt; rescaling, but uses numbers of molecules for substance 
&gt; definitions. The 
&gt; problematic point here is that the kinetic law should really 
&gt; be &lt;kineticLaw formula="(KcF * MEMBRANE_Enzyme  * compA_X)/( KmS + 
&gt; (compA_X/compA.volume))"&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; instead of
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;kineticLaw formula="(KcF * MEMBRANE_Enzyme  * compA_X)/( KmS 
&gt; + compA_X)"&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; but how does one access the volume (here I used compA.volume, 
&gt; but such 
&gt; usage is not defined anywhere)?
&gt; 
&gt; Note also that
&gt; &lt;kineticLaw formula="uui(compA_X, KcF * MEMBRANE_Enzyme, 
&gt; KmS)"&gt; would be incorrect,  while &lt;kineticLaw 
&gt; formula="compA.volume * uui(compA_X/compA.volume, KcF * 
&gt; MEMBRANE_Enzyme, KmS)"&gt;
&gt; would be correct.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;I (JDesigner author) assume that the author of a model has made sure 
&gt; &gt;that the units they are using are correct and compatible, I 
&gt; don't check 
&gt; &gt;if this is the case. As far as I am aware all modeling tools 
&gt; do this. 
&gt; &gt;Even tools such as Matlab make no attempt to check your 
&gt; units, it's up 
&gt; &gt;to the model builder to do this. Since I don't check on 
&gt; units it means 
&gt; &gt;that users are not restricted to what they can use, they can use mM, 
&gt; &gt;microM etc, what ever is suitable, but they must make sure that the 
&gt; &gt;parameter units correspond. In SBML if you don't specify 
&gt; units then the 
&gt; &gt;numbers can mean what ever the modeller intended.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; The SBML specification says that the default unit for substances is 
&gt; "mole", not whatever the modeller intends!
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;For real models one should of course indicate somewhere
&gt; &gt;in the SBML what the basic units are.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I don't think this is an unreasonable requirement for the 
&gt; user to do, I 
&gt; &gt;presume that our users are scientists (i.e they have PhDs 
&gt; etc) and will 
&gt; &gt;understand the importance of compatible units!
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Most scientists are well aware of this, that is why there is 
&gt; a separate 
&gt; notation for concentrations
&gt; and molecule numbers: [X] is the concentration of species X. 
&gt; It is only 
&gt; for convenience that the [] is often left out.
