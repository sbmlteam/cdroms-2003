Hi all,


&gt; &gt; I have a book in front of me called "Theory of Modeling and Simulation"
&gt; &gt; 2nd ed., by Zeigler, Praehofer &amp; Kim. I remember listening to a talk on
&gt; &gt; E-cell (can't remember whether it was given by Takeshi), in which this
&gt; &gt; book was cited as the 'basis' for E-cell - is that so, Takeshi? 

I think that was me -- I gave a short talk in the SBML meeting at your unversity.  (herts.ac.uk).

As Takeshi wrote for me, E-Cell Version 3's fundamental algorithm is inspired by
Zeigler's rigid theory of discrete event simulation.    However, the approach is
very different actually.   It's basically unique, except that I borrowed some fundamental 
concepts from Zeigler's theory.     Such as:  (1) the fact that it can be mathematically
proven that any time driven simulation algorithms can be mixed in the framework of
discrete event, (2) discrete-event scheduling method, and (3), hi classification of simulation 
algorithms (see below).

Actually I'm now writing my phd thesis on this :)


Zeigler proposed two different ways to combine different formalisms:  combining and
embedding.   The former means that it is possible to 'combine' two different algorithms
into one more powerful one (such as Zeigler's DEVS&amp;DESS).    E-Cell's algorithm
is different, and may be classified into the latter category, in which each different
algorithm is embedded in the 'discrete-event world view' as a module.   

One design goal of my algorithm, which I believe is one good characteristic of my work,
is to keep orthogonality between algorithm modules:
which means that existing simulation algorithms (such as Gillespie, ODE solvers, automata,
and anything) can be used with no or a little modification.     
I think this is very important because we already have many simulation algorithms
and many partial models of cellular systems on those algorithms.   A big challenge for
a simulator developer now is how to combine these existing sub-models to construct
a higher-order models (such as a whole-cell scale simulation).



&gt; &gt; To get back to your email, Ed, Zeigler et al. distinguish 3 types
&gt; &gt; (formalisms) of dynamic model specification (as opposed to e.g. object
&gt; &gt; modelling, in which there is no concept of time): the Discrete Time
&gt; &gt; (DTSS), Differential Equation (DESS), and Discrete Event (DEVS) System
&gt; &gt; Specifications. DESS includes ODE and PDE descriptions. DTSS includes
&gt; &gt; things such as cellular automata (which are updated as a whole in a unit
&gt; &gt; 'time' step). 

This is one thing I borrowed from his theory.  
E-Cell provides three fundamental 'Stepper' classes, DiscreteTimeStepper, DifferentialStepper,
and DiscreteEventStepper.


&gt; I think (but I'm not entirely sure) that DEVS includes
&gt; &gt; stochastic models (in which possible state transitions have certain
&gt; &gt; probabilities), but also threshold models (in which a state transition
&gt; &gt; occurs when a certain parameter crosses a given threshold). Have I
&gt; &gt; understood this correctly?

DEVS include stochastic models, but DTS and DES can also be stochastic.   
(stochastic automata and stochastic differential equations)


Gillespie's family of algorithms is one good example of discrete-event simulation framework.


We have tried to use E-Cell to do composite simulation of Gillespie-Gibson and ODE 
(we used Dormand-Prince 4(5)7M algorithm), and we found that
it can improve the performance 600+ times in our case.  
Actually it exceeds both pure-Gillespie and pure-ODE runs.   
We are also trying some other combinations.  
For example, we have a long-term depression model of a neuron
which has a discrete-time and an ODE sub-models.

P.S.  
If you are interested, more detailed description of E-Cell's algorithm is available upon request. 
Sorry, it is still an unpublished work.
