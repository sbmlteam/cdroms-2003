Not to make a complicated situation worse... ;)

We actually have three connection points, with
the third being where the catalysts/modifiers
hook in. Of course, for us, it's no problem to
compute where that is: it's midway between the
reactants and products points.

But, I wonder if we're overthinking this a bit,
and think it's worth confirming what it is we
are after. You see, no matter what representation(s)
we come up with in the SBML, after we read the
model into the Virtual Cell, we are going to ONLY
be able to render it in our renderer, so there will
obviously be *some* conversion. Now, those of you
who have seen the Virtual Cell may remember that we
represent reactions as a "barbell" shaped glyph
(which Jim has since modified a bit). Thus, while
the EML group is thinking of a reaction glyph being
a short line segment between two points, after
reading their models into the Virtual Cell, their
reactions will look like a "barbell" NO MATTER WHAT.

And that was a best-case scenario, since EML's rep
and the Virtual Cell's rep are almost identical.
Now, consider the case where Herbert imports one
of their models, with his rep being quite distinct.

And this leads me to my point: are we trying to
specify *EXACTLY* what a reaction should look like,
and then expecting that EXACT look to be reproduced?

The answer is obviously NO.

And this leads me to the next question, which was
brought up before but was not answered to my satisfaction
(which was OK, I thought it might be good to make some
progress before revisiting it): just how far do we
want to go in specifying the EXACT DETAILS of what
the layout looked like in each particular tool?

Perhaps this would be a good time to think about
this question again, before we embark on trying
to spec out two different approaches to reactions,
or generalizing them into one that works both ways.

&gt; 
&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; it seems that, again, we will have to make some general decision: 
&gt; Do we want to have several ways to represent reactions in our 
&gt; layout (to 
&gt; reflect the different way existing programs deal with 
&gt; reactions) or do we 
&gt; want to find one way to represent reactions.
&gt; The one way would need to be fairly general to allow most 
&gt; other cases to be 
&gt; translated. It would therefore be unnecessarily complex for 
&gt; some simple 
&gt; cases. 
&gt; 
&gt; In our proposal we tried to find a compromise between generality and 
&gt; simplicity: 
&gt; A graphical representation of a reaction in our proposal 
&gt; consists of the 
&gt; coordinates of exactly two nodes. One node is where the 
&gt; substrate arcs meet, 
&gt; the other is where the product arcs meet. Optionally 
&gt; information about the 
&gt; curve connecting the nodes could be given (not yet in our 
&gt; proposal). Also the 
&gt; graphical representation of the reaction contains a list of graphical 
&gt; representations of species references. These contain 
&gt; information on which 
&gt; species glyphs connect to which node of the graphical 
&gt; representation of the 
&gt; reaction. Optionally also information on the form of the curve. 
&gt; (In the attached figure the red squares are the nodes of the 
&gt; graphical 
&gt; representaion of the reaction. The green curves are the graphical 
&gt; representations of the species references. The blue circles 
&gt; are the graphical 
&gt; representations of species. So the red and green objects 
&gt; together form the 
&gt; graphical repsresentation of the reaction)
&gt; 
&gt; Of course more general graphical representations of reactions 
&gt; could be thought 
&gt; of (like an arbitrary number of nodes in the reaction). 
&gt; 
&gt; If a program internally deals with only one node (center of 
&gt; reaction) it could 
&gt; either give the two nodes the same coordinates or regard them 
&gt; as one point 
&gt; plus a tangent.
&gt; 
&gt; So what do you think? Do we need a more general definition? 
&gt; Do we need several 
&gt; cases for simple reactions and complicated reactions? Or 
&gt; could there be a 
&gt; compromise similar to our proposal?

&gt; &gt; You're correct, Jdesigner does have an explict reaction 
&gt; section, instead
&gt; &gt; the whole line from reactants to products represents the 
&gt; reaction, thus
&gt; &gt; clicking anywhere on the line will bring up the reaction 
&gt; property box. No
&gt; &gt; harm though in allowing people to have special symbols or 
&gt; sections of the
&gt; &gt; line that represent the reaction.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 	&gt;I also agree with Herbert et al about line placement, but we
&gt; &gt; 	&gt;need to think pretty hard about it so that everyone is happy.
&gt; &gt; 	&gt;For example, JDesigner (as I recall) doesn't have a
&gt; &gt; 	&gt;graphical representation for the reaction; instead, the
&gt; &gt; 	&gt;reaction is represented by the collection of lines in
&gt; &gt; 	&gt;an implicit manner. On the other hand, the Virtual Cell
&gt; &gt; 	&gt;group takes an approach similar to the EML approach, with
&gt; &gt; 	&gt;two (x, y) points representing the reaction (one point
&gt; &gt; 	&gt;where reactants hook in, one where products hook in).
&gt; &gt; 	&gt;I think we need to treat both approaches.
