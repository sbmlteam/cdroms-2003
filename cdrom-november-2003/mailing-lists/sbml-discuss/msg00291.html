Hugh, all graphics applications have the same issue with missing fonts, if a
font can't be found the app tries to make an intelligent decision (or not at
all and the font is missing), we've all see this happen, in fact I just
loaded a PS file and one font was missing (some wierd sounding font). One
solution is to embed the fonts (don't know if this would go down well), what
ever we do I think we must be permitted to specify fonts.

Andrew,
        My point about fonts is that your part C (relative bounding box 
size of text) is intimately bound here. On the computer producing the 
graphic this will result in all boxes being neatly filled with a font 
found on the computer. 
In another machine using a different font face:-
1) some boxes will be over-filled (disaster) 
2) If the user program resizes to fill each box fonts will be mixed in 
size (very annoying).
3) If the users resizes all text to fit the smallest box relative to the

font kerning some boxes will look odd as the text will not fill the box 
(also annoying). 
The narrower and smaller the initial font is the more likely the first 
eventuality will occur.
        Either we nail things down very tightly, or we will have to live

with line/text crossing artifacts. I'm afraid that the latter is going
to 
be the case. 
        I have advocated the minimal aproach from the beginning. Your 
elaboration for style sheets seems a reasonable idea if we can agree on
a 
controlled vocabulary. As proteins can be enzymes, substrates, products,

inhibitors, etc of reactions, do we represent them always the same or 
differently depending on what they are doing at the time [8-)]?

plan and other 
suggestions

Folks

This message contains 2 suggestions:

a) a possible plan for developing DWG work further

b) a possible architecture for diagramming SBML

Important: consider these independent

a) The plan
   --------

Some people think that there is a very minimal set of information
required
for rendering a diagram of an SBML that could be defined as
a DWG level A proposal.  (I use 'A' to avoid confusion
with whole SBML Levels).  This minimal set would be along
the lines described by the group at EML.  IMHO the group could
make useful progress if it decided to define a Level A 
over the summer.  For example an experimental annotation
could be developed and implemented for the SBML interoperability
hackafon 
(or trial) in August and/or a proposal written for the 
November SBML forum meeting in St Louis.

I believe this would allow the DWG to see how much/how little
mileage can be gained from a minimalist approach and would
identify what further elements are really required for Level B
and beyond. 

Important: this plan doesn't assume that a minimal form
would look anything like the form described in the next section.
Nor does it make any assumptions about what levels B+ would be like.

b) An Architecture for Diagramming
   -------------------------------

The basic idea is to

i) encode very minimal graph information in SBML
ii) encode information that might be used for rendering in a way that
                 makes that information useable by other tools that may 
not
                 be graphical
iii) detailed rendering is controlled by a stylesheet which maps
                 classes of objects in sbml to specific renderings

This architecture works with one or more views of the same model
(each view can have a different style)

In detail:

(i) IMHO From a user perspective the minimal requirement for rendering a
network transmitted in a format like SBML
is to see the network laid out in a similar form as it was in the
source application preserving the following details:

                 a) relative positions of nodes.
                 b) relative paths of arcs
                 c) content plus relative bounding box size and position

of text 
                 d) relative size of icon/glyph/picture of nodes
                 e) node types

One result and aim of this is that new line crossings, line node, line
text crossing
artifacts are not introduced.  On point (e): I don't believe that
a user really cares how a given node type is rendered in detail
just that node type information is preserved and that nodes
of a given type are rendered consistently.

(from a graph perspective nodes in SBML are reactions and species)

One clear advantage of this approach is that it clearly defines
what graphical components an application must support to successfully
(minimally)
render a diagram.

Flexible rendering of text inside a node picture is problematic when the
node picture could change with different stylesheets.

(ii) encoding node type information in SBML rather than rendering
information,
for example node color, enables other tools to use type information
captured
in a graphical tool to be used in other tools and visa versa.  It also
enables users to create queries on model databases in a meaningful way. 

This presupposes that there is a controlled vocabulary (CV) of node
types.
We could either adopt existing CVs e.g. BioPAX, CellML,
Daniel Cook (Uni. of Wash.) or create our own.  IMHO To be feasible the
CV would
have to be independent of SBML with a separate curation/development
process.

But we don't initially need to get hung up on this: a model could define
its own CV as an alternative to some globally defined CV.
This would at least enable a diagram's nodes to be re-rendered
consistently.

(iii) Given (i) its not difficult to see that you can create an
independent
format which describes systematically how elements of a minimal
graphical
form are rendered in detail.  For example a stylesheet can define that
all proteins are rendered as blue circles with a yellow border.

Stylesheets can be associated with a diagram in a number of ways:
included inline with the diagram, referenced by the diagram in a
separate
file or by the user immediately before rendering.

This architecture has been used successfully in Cytoscape and I believe
that Poul Neilson is planning on adopting an approach roughly
along the lines described here for tools that operate on CellML models.
