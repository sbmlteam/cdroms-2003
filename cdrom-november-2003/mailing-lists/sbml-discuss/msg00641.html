Thanks for your proposal.

Comments:

The separation of layout from rendering provide us
with a mechanism for encoding a style sheet
approach to rendering given that more than one SBML
component, e.g. species, can refer to the same render group.

I suggest that we consider having default render group identification
mechanism so that its possible to plug-in a render section
into a model without having to specify the render groups
on the glyph structures.  This makes sense to me since
most diagrams will have a consistent look.

for example:

&lt;species id="x"/&gt;
...
&lt;speciesGlyph species="x" x="20" y="10" w="50" h="50"&gt;
...
&lt;renderGroup defaultType="species"&gt;
	&lt;shape shape="StandCircle"&gt;
		&lt;transformation sx="50.0" sy="50.0"/&gt;
	&lt;shape/&gt;
&lt;/renderGroup&gt;

Obviously this mechanism needs to relate to roles etc.
In the longer term the render element could be in a different
document from the glyph elements.  To make this work we probably
do need flexible bounding boxes for text/nodes.

Is there provision for a background color for the whole diagram?

Is there any reason why the layout and rendering elements have
to be in a separate namespace?  I don't have opinion on this
but what are your reasons?

I'm concerned that the role attribute is building a fixed
controlled vocabulary (CV) that can't be easily extended modified.
In addition this information has much wider use beyond just layout
information (although I acknowledge that it may be first used for real
in layout processing).  I think we need to think carefully about
how we tackle the use of CVs in SBML considering existing work
by groups such as BioPAX.  IMHO It'll be better if 'role'
is integrated into SBML if the layout structures end up in a separate
namespace.  There is a real danger that we could have overlapping CVs in
SBML documents.

I suggest that you, if there is time, draw the UML diagram(s) for your
proposals,
in our experience this make understanding XML standard proposals easier
on the reader.

Forgive my ignorance but what is an affine transformation?

I tend to agree with Herbert that how you tackle text and font
sizing is very important to the success of any layout proposal.
Again I haven't picked up the following from your documents
perhaps I have overlooked something or got confused.

What text by default if any is displayed with compartments, reactions
and species
or are labels explicit?
If labels are explicit where are they specified?
By default what font and font size are used to render this text?
If there is a default mechanism how are the defaults set?

IMHO the render group mechanism needs to support implicit text labels
taken from the SBML component's id or name.  The render group should
specify the font and font size for these text labels. 
The render group should be able to specify that the text is or isn't
displayed at all.
The glyph should specify whether the bounding box is flexible or not. 
If we don't do something like this scheme then you have to have a render
group
(or something) for each sbml component displayed.

Thanks for again for your efforts: its looking good.

yours

&gt; Subject: Re: [sbml-discuss] DWG: Revised Proposal
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; The layout information is simply that, positional 
&gt; information for the
&gt; &gt; varous parts of the diagram? The only information that is given are 
&gt; &gt; positions of the nodes and the coordinates of the edges?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Yes that is correct. The only exception being the 
&gt; speciesReferenceGlyphs that can specify a curve instead of just a 
&gt; bounding box.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Is there any information on objects other than modeling specific 
&gt; &gt; objects, or is this information reserved for the rendering 
&gt; info (see 
&gt; &gt; Jonathon's proposal for example).
&gt; 
&gt; First of all, the reference to objects in the model is 
&gt; optional for all 
&gt; Glyph objects, so you can have a CompartmentGlyph in the layout that 
&gt; does not reference a Compartment in the Model.
&gt; For all other objects that have absolutely nothing to do with 
&gt; reaction 
&gt; networks, we have the listOfAdditionalGraphicalObjects. So if 
&gt; you would 
&gt; like to include a picture of your red ferrari in the layout, you add 
&gt; some bounding box to this list and reference a bitmap of the 
&gt; car in the 
&gt; render parts listOfShapes.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; In the proposal you mention the bounding box but don't give an 
&gt; &gt; example. I can't easily read xml-schema, so I need to ask is the 
&gt; &gt; bounding box optional? I also notice you have a role attribute, is 
&gt; &gt; this optional?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; The bounding box that is mentioned is a set of attributes on 
&gt; the glyph 
&gt; objects. If you take for example the SpeciesGlyph it has the 
&gt; attributes 
&gt; x,y,z and w,h,d where z and d are optional and default to 0.0. The 
&gt; x,y,z attributes are used to set the position of the bounding box and 
&gt; the w,h,d are the width, height and depth respectively. The 
&gt; x,y,w and h 
&gt; attributes are not optional, so no, the bounding box is not optional.
&gt; The SpeciesReferenceGlyph is somewhat different since it can either 
&gt; have a bounding box object which again has the above mentioned 
&gt; attributes or it can have a curve that specifies the arrow 
&gt; that is used 
&gt; to represent the relation. Actually one of the two should be 
&gt; given, so 
&gt; there might be a mistake in the schema specification because there it 
&gt; would be optional.
&gt; The role attribute is indeed optional and it can be used to 
&gt; specify the 
&gt; role of the SpeciesReference in the reaction without having to figure 
&gt; it out from the kinetics. So if your program draws inhibitors 
&gt; differently from activators you could specify wether it is one or the 
&gt; other. If you use the render part as well, this would be redundant 
&gt; information since you would probably specify the complete render 
&gt; information there anyway.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; The pseudo node coordinates I presume can coincide? I ask 
&gt; this because 
&gt; &gt; some of us don't use a straight line segment in the center of the 
&gt; &gt; reaction arc.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Yes the two points of the reaction can coincide. Actually you can 
&gt; either see those two points as two pseudo nodes or as a bounding box. 
&gt; In the second case, you could specify some renderGroup (see render 
&gt; part) to be drawn inside this bounding box. Maybe this is a little 
&gt; ambiguous and should be changed.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Without rendering info, is there any recommandation for font sizes 
&gt; &gt; since you have width and height infor for node sizes, if 
&gt; the font size 
&gt; &gt; isn't chosen appropriately then the font will over flow the box. I 
&gt; &gt; think I would like to see something that indicates whether the node 
&gt; &gt; bounding box should be elastic or fixed, if elastic then 
&gt; the box will 
&gt; &gt; resize according to the font used. This is what I do in 
&gt; jdesigner and 
&gt; &gt; it avoids any font sizing issues.
&gt; 
&gt; This assumes that everybody will be drawing the nodes as text labels 
&gt; which might not be the case. Without render information it is 
&gt; up to the 
&gt; program what is drawn inside the bounding box.
&gt; I have not given any thought to elastic bounding boxes yet. 
&gt; Don't they 
&gt; defy the purpose of a bounding box? If I have some layout, so I want 
&gt; the program to be able to enlarge bounding boxes even though 
&gt; this might 
&gt; end up in a messy layout? If a text label would not fit into a given 
&gt; bounding box, would it not make more sense to have the layout 
&gt; recalculated?
&gt; What do other people think about his?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; On first glance, I can't see anything which records the background 
&gt; &gt; colour? Do you have one?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Short answer: not yet.
&gt; Longer answer: Since we did not specify concrete examples for shapes, 
&gt; we did not bother with their details yet. All the document states so 
&gt; far is that there will de an abstract class shape and that all shapes 
&gt; that will eventually be defined are subclasses of Shape. We are not 
&gt; sure yet if it would make sense to have an attribute for background 
&gt; color in Shape directly rather than in the subclasses (where needed). 
&gt; E.g. you might not need a background color for text label shapes or 
&gt; bitmaps. Actually depending on how we handle this, a 
&gt; background  color 
&gt; may not be needed at all. You could for example just draw 
&gt; some text on 
&gt; a filled rectangle that has the color you want as the background.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I was looking at the rendering document and noticed that 
&gt; most of it is 
&gt; &gt; in schema notation, probably I'm the only one but I find it 
&gt; difficult 
&gt; &gt; to read schema (it's like trying to read a C program that's 
&gt; written in 
&gt; &gt; assembler), would it be possible to put more real examples?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I don't think you would be the only one having difficulties 
&gt; reading the 
&gt; schema notation and as you can see from the mistakes that I made 
&gt; writing it, I am not as comfortable with it as I would wish. Actually 
&gt; we had hoped that the text would make the points clear we were trying 
&gt; to make without having to rely on the schema. Obviously this 
&gt; is not the 
&gt; case and I apologize for that. As this is just a first draft and 
&gt; doesn't have all the features that are needed, it is somehow 
&gt; difficult 
&gt; to give examples. I tried to make up a short example towards 
&gt; the end to 
&gt; demonstrate how layout and render information would play 
&gt; together. For 
&gt; this I already made up some Shapes like text labels and 
&gt; circle, but as 
&gt; I just said, I made this just up for this example, we haven't defined 
&gt; any concrete shapes yet. We had hoped to get some feedback as to what 
&gt; kind of shapes people would need first. So could you tell us 
&gt; what kind 
&gt; of basic shapes you would like to have and the properties 
&gt; they need. As 
&gt; stated in the document, we are probably going to borrow some of the 
&gt; notation from SVG, we only need to know what is needed first.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I hope I could clarify some of the issues raised.
&gt; Thanks a lot for the feedback and we hope to hear more along this line
&gt;
