&gt; I would add that composition of models implies a hierarchical structure.
&gt; Are you implying that composition should restricted to one level?

There is certainly a hierarchy of composition.  I think there are
multiple kinds of hierarchy a user may want to impose on a model.
Composition is a particular kind of hierarchy and, of necessity,
a fairly rigid one.  By this I mean you are forced to construct
the hierarchy following the structure of components.  If you
change the hierarchy, you've either changed the model or you've
changed the content of one or more components.  Users may wish to
use hierarchy as a structuring mechanism for presentation purposes
without altering the definition of the model.

I do not mean to imply composition is limited to a single level.
Any given model or component may reference other models as components.
The depth of nesting is not bounded by the design of the composition
mechanism.

&gt; I'm a bit confused as to how you would compose 2 instances of the same
&gt; sub-model in your scheme.  Do you have an example?

Roughly as follows:

&lt;listOfComponentInstances&gt;
  &lt;elementReference xlink:label="ref1" xlink:href="...somewhere in A" /&gt;
  &lt;elementReference xlink:label="ref2" xlink:href="...somewhere in B" /&gt;
  &lt;elementReference xlink:label="ref3" xlink:href="...somehwere in C" /&gt;

  &lt;componentInstance xlink:href="componentA.sbml"&gt;
    &lt;link xlink:from="ref2" xlink:to="ref1" /&gt;
... other links potentially ...
  &lt;/componentInstance&gt;

  &lt;componentInstance xlink:href="componentA.sbml"&gt;
    &lt;link xlink:from="ref3" xlink:to="ref1" /&gt;
... other links potentially ...
  &lt;/componentInstance&gt;
&lt;/listOfComponentInstances&gt;

Each occurance of a componentInstance element defines a new occurance
of a component, a copy if you will.  Each instance has an implied,
distinct name space in the composed model, part of the encapsulation
model.  This needs to be developed in more detail in one of the
missing sections but what I have in mind is the usual symbol renaming
approach a-la free variable renaming in proof theories.

&gt; I believe we need to work towards a model composition
&gt; standard with the following features:
&gt;
&gt; a) Interfaces
&gt;
&gt; I think we can use defined interfaces.  In fact in some contexts they
&gt; will be very useful
&gt; for example they will guide users to those elements that the sub-model
&gt; author
&gt; thought were appropriate places to link to other models.

I view interface definition as a documentation issue in the development
of a component.  I argue in the presentation we can't do type checking,
one of the main things you get from the definition of interfaces.  Without
a meaningful notion of type, I would argue you can't systematically
represent the meaning of a model as anything more than an organized
collection of labels, useful but very difficult to analyze.  It is
incumbent on the developer of a model to provide useful documentation
about the structure and use of a component.  This includes such things
as selecting the set of labels to be meaningful in the context of the
application.  There is nothing preventing a model developer from assigning
labels A, B, C, ... to species elements when they in fact represent
known compounds like a calcium ion, a phosphate group, atomic oxygen, ...

Similarly, it is incumbent upon the user of a component to understand
the intent and structure of the component.  Writing good components
in a modelling language is and always will be difficult.  A user
must evaluate whether a given _implementation_ of a component is
indeed suitable for use in a particular application.

Having said we can't do type checking, I will say there are some things
we can check which are types at the level of SBML/XML.  These fall in the
category of reference consistency for various attributes.  For example,
a species reference in a reaction must refer to a species label.  There
are similar kinds of checks one can make with the composition model
and these will need to be enumerated; notionally, they are part of
the definition of the combined model, yet another of the missing
sections.  An example of what I have in mind here is you can't link
a species element to anything other than a species element, an
example you mention later in your message.

&gt; Interfaces
&gt; enable two sub-models
&gt; to be composed graphically without the whole of the sub-models being
&gt; visible.

I view this use of an interface defintion as being the responsibility
of a model editor.  We may wish to provide specific elements in SBML to
identify these attributes of a model but I would argue they are in no
way part of the _definition_ of the composed model.  I consider them
to be analogous to graph layout information.

&gt; A user can chose whether interfaces
&gt; should be respected or not.  I think we can do some useful link checking
&gt; without labels
&gt; e.g. making sure that elements of different types aren't linked e.g.
&gt; species to compartment
&gt; in addition parameter units can be checked e.g. block a volts parameter
&gt; being connected to a
&gt; moles parameter.  In fact this was a motivation behind units.

Again, more detail is needed on the combined form of a composed model.
One of those details is the constraints on link targets and a set of
rules needs to be developed.

As an aside, I'm not sure I agree with your example about substituting
"volts" for "moles" - consider the case where a user is building
a model representing an experiment.  Concentration may be measured
as a voltage.  Is it a _good_ idea to mix the 2 concepts without
an appropriate conversion term?  Proabably not.  Should we actually
specify it to not be possible?  Again, I would argue no since I see
this as an issue of model quality rather than correctness.  It might
be a suitable rule for a lint-like application but I would contend it's
probably not something to specify for the definition of the language.

&gt; b) Alternative model 'implementations'
&gt;
&gt; It would be very useful to have alternative submodel "implementations"
&gt; for the same subsystem.
&gt; Alternative sub-models can model at different levels of details and/or
&gt; use different math
&gt; representations.
&gt;
&gt; The main problem with this is providing a labeling mechanism that would
&gt; allow users
&gt; to select the set of sub-models that should be applied to a given tool.
&gt; This implies
&gt; a kind of ontology that's either public or private to just a given set
&gt; of models.

I'll presume you mean something analogous to conditional compilation
here and hope you'll elaborate if I've missed your point.  Also, I
view this as somewhat orthogonal to the definition of components
due, at least in part, to my opinions about how these capabilities
should be addressed.

The goal is to allow information from the usage environment to have
an impact on the definition of the model.  The obvious mechanism is
a conditional like the #ifdef macros in the C preprocessor.  My
experience with C is this becomes a maintenance nightmare very
quickly.  You get combinatoric explosion of feature combinations
very quickly and the code becomes very bulky and difficult to
understand.  I believe some combination of XSLT conditional elements
and parameters would be a suitable implementation for this type
of functionality.  I don't think any changes are required in
SBML with this approach.

I would argue this specific example is a minor variant of the notion
of model families,  a collection of implementations of related models
where the "bulk" of a model is the same and selected variants are made.
XML documents are structured data streams suitable for inclusion in
databases.  With the understanding I am not really a user, I want to
store models in a database and my component library is a real database
rather than a simple file.  As such, I would construct variants using
something like XUpdate, see <A  HREF="http://www.xmldb.org/xupdate/">http://www.xmldb.org/xupdate/</A> for its
defintion and <A  HREF="http://xml.apache.org/xindice/">http://xml.apache.org/xindice/</A> for a particular
implementation.  Each variant would somehow have a set of attributes
describing its criteria for selection, my preference here would be
an RDF based, or similar, attribute model.  Whether the attribute
descriptions for a variant are just part of the model metadata or
if they need some special standing in the defintion of SBML is something
I haven't worked out yet.

I'm not sure I understand your comment about an ontology.

&gt; c) overloading
&gt;
&gt; You wondered how we would resolve the attributes of linked elements.
&gt; There are 3 possible complementary mechanisms:
&gt;
&gt; i) abstraction - allow some attributes to be undefined/missing
&gt; (typically this needs to be restricted
&gt; to just those elements on the interface of a model).  some attributes
&gt; are already optional in SBML.
&gt; A missing attribute value is then overloaded by a 'concrete' element
&gt; which has an attribute value.
&gt;
&gt; ii) hierarchical overloading - an attribute value from a higher level
&gt; overloads a lower level attribute value.
&gt;
&gt; iii) directed linking - label one end of a link as being an overloader
&gt; that supplies the attribute value.

I think this is a case of my not making a very effective presentation.
What I have in mind is a combination of the 3 of your mechanisms.
Starting with (iii), links are directed with the "xlink:from" attribute
of a link element defining the parent and the "xlink:to" attribute
defining the child.  The final value of an attribute in the composed
model is (ii) followed by (i).  In words, look for the attribute in
the parent.  If it's not defined, look for it in the child.  Recurse
if there are multiple levels to the definition of the element (e.g.
the child target of a link in a component could itself be the parent
of a link in the definition of the component).

&gt; (... the problems with XPath etc... are)
&gt;
&gt; a) XPATH can only refer to concrete XML structures.  Structures that are
&gt; inferred
&gt; by SBML - in the future - such as the inside of a specific model
&gt; instance can't be referred
&gt; to (if you allow any number of instances of the same sub-model).  I
&gt; guess it can be done by
&gt; a pair of XPATHs one to the instance and the other to inside the
&gt; sub-model.

I don't think I understand what you mean with this.  Could you give
me an example?

&gt; b) these standards work fine if you use them in combination with the
&gt; 'source' data structures.
&gt; You can apply them to DOM representations easily.  However you're
&gt; operating on your
&gt; own non-DOM representation you have write you're own parser - XPATH
&gt; isn't XML! :-(

I think people should be using DOM, SAX, etc... rather than rolling
their own parsers.  The additional constraints for SBML model checking
should be written on top of those APIs.

&gt; Many developers prefer to parse direct to custom structures.  Are there
&gt; parsers for XPATH?

I've started looking at this some.  There are a number of XPath
processors out there, Xindice being one I have some familiarity
with although it's not strictly a XPath processor.  I've not yet
seen any I would consider useful components.  That said, the grammar
for XPath is not terribly complex and writing a *CC style representation
doesn't strike me as difficult.  I've seen references to grammars
suitable for parser generators but haven't tried to track one down yet.

&gt; c) these standards can be unconstrained - for example you can write
&gt; references to ranges of elements
&gt; in contexts where this is meaningless - this might require some
&gt; complexity for a
&gt; validator.  A custom format based on XML might well make this impossible
&gt; at the syntactic level.

My general preference is to let users have as much rope as they want.
Next, XML is a poor choice as a representation for enforcing syntactic
checks and SBML, being an XML application, inherits this.  A validator
will always work with a specific model instance and should be constructed
to resolve linked elements.  I think once you have the result of the
XPath expression in the link element, the validation is not much
different than checking an interface definition or many of the other
constraints SBML imposes over and above those possible to specify
in a XSchema definition.
