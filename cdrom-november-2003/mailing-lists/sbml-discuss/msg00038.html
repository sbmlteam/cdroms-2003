Folks

Nicolas Le Novere raised the issue of the
units of kinetic laws in SBML.
I apologize for not answering this point
earlier.

In both L1 and L2 the formula used to 
define the rate of a given reaction is defined
to be amount/time (moles/second by default).
This is reasonable since reactions change
species amount directly and only species 
concentration indirectly.  
 
We are aware that many modelers use 
concentration/time or amount/volume/time
(moles/liter/second by default) when 
defining rate of change formulae
for species.  Thus we defined
species concentration rules that have these
units.

So at first this may seem to be inconsistent both
within SBML and perhaps with the approach of the
modeling community.

However there is a reason for this:

a) Kinetic laws on reactions don't define the
rate of change of a single species. In fact
the rate of change of species is composed 
from the rate laws of all reactions in which
the species is either a reactant or product.
The result is a formula that defines a rate of
change of amount for the species.

b) A reaction can have a transport component
i.e. move species from one compartment to another
where each compartment can have a different volume.

Consider the situation where there are 3 species A, B and
C all in separate compartments with volumes Va, Vb, and Vc
respectively.  We define a transporting reaction A -&gt; B + C
with a rate law k[A]  

the rates of change of amount are 

A' = -k[A]
B' = k[A]
C' = k[A]

and thus the rates of change of concentration are:

[A]' = -k[A]/Va
[B]' = k[A]/Vb
[C]' = k[A]/Vc

One immediate observation of this is if you
don't care about volume and compartments:
you just locate everything inside a single unit 
compartment and then [A] = A thus returning the
math to the conventional representation.
In fact one of the options for SBML L2
is to have 'default' unit volume compartment
i.e. if you don't supply a compartment the distinction
between amount and concentration effectively disappears.

Lets consider a definition of rate laws that
might seem rational: the rate law defines the rate of 
change of concentration of the species in the reaction.
Thus we have

[A]' = -k[A]
[B]' = k[A]
[C]' = k[A]

therefore the rates of change of amount are

A' = -k[A]Va
B' = k[A]Vb
C' = k[A]Vc

Hopefully you'd agree that this is incorrect:
this suggests that you can increase the rate of increase of
amount of C simply by enlarging C's compartment.

I'd be interested to know if you have
any problems with the above.

yours Andrew Finney
