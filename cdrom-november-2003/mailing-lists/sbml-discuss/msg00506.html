&gt; So lets put the credentials aside. Obviously, its really important to
&gt; work through the bits and tweak your system's performance. Its equally
&gt; important to make sure that the validity of your user's modeling
&gt; efforts dont depend on it! 

I agree.
I didn't deny anything.   What you are making seems quite correct
and I'm just showing my view on that... except that I couldn't get
anything convincing to make light of Zeigler's theory :)


&gt; &gt; I was not talking about the syntax/semantics separation when I said algorithms
&gt; &gt; are parts of models, though I was when I said we must distinguish models
&gt; &gt; from implementations.   And I was not talking about languages.	
&gt; &gt; When talking about formal languages and induction engines
&gt; &gt; it is the core concept, but in numerical simulators it is not always true.
&gt; &gt; You may agree that if we need to assure the interoperability, it should be 
&gt; &gt; done in the level of the higher level languages, not in data structures of
&gt; &gt; implementations.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I meant that when we choose to use differential equations it implicitly but definitely
&gt; &gt; indicate we understand, or at least we are trying to understand the dynamics of 
&gt; &gt; the model in terms of, continuous and deterministic computation (I meant this
&gt; &gt; by 'algorithm').   
&gt; &gt;   
&gt; Two points.
&gt; 
&gt; (1) Hmm. Of course differential equations have dynamic content, just
&gt; as procedures and higher-order functions do (albeit for different
&gt; notions of "time").  But this doesnt mean that they have to be
&gt; understood only through their "execution". In all these cases there
&gt; are also abtract mathematical ways of understanding them.
&gt; 
&gt; (2) I dont believe that there is anything fundamentally different
&gt; about "numerical simulators" vs "formal languages and induction
&gt; engines". (I dont actually know what induction engines you are talking
&gt; about; I assume you mean reasoning engines). The only distinction I
&gt; see is that one deals with the continuous domain --- and of course
&gt; that has a lot of interesting and challenging structure in its own
&gt; right -- and the other has traditionally dealt with discrete
&gt; phenomena.


In the program/implementation model below, no one would disagree that
the separation must be:

-----------------------------
 Language  (program)
-----------------------------   &lt;&lt;----  here
 Engine    (implementation)
-----------------------------


While there are two possibilities on this one:

-------------------------------------------
 Model (semantic? model 
        -- I don't have the right word)
-------------------------------------------  &lt;&lt;--- (1)
 Model (specific dynamics 
               e.g. ODE or stochastic)
-------------------------------------------  &lt;&lt;--- (2)
 Engine (implementation)
-------------------------------------------


I meant in many numeric simulators there are boundaries at (1),
and the structure of the model and choice of the way how it
drives the model are often specified in separate files.
It is so because it is useful, but I argued that in some cases
cutting at (2) is also very useful, and
often necessary for composite simulations.

I guess you meant that, especially in your domain, the boundary
is already at (2).   

Useful practical language like SBML may need to support separation at
both layers;  (1) and (2).

&gt; (3) There may be another thing going on here. There is of course a lot
&gt; of really good work to be done around meta-architectures for modeling
&gt; and reasoning: systems intended to be extensible by end-users, each
&gt; extension to be thought of as yielding an architecture for reasoning.
&gt; The possibility of such meta-architectures has really been facilitated
&gt; over the last 20 years by the emergence of OO languages, and
&gt; reflection/introspection techniques. Indeed a well-designed API can
&gt; allow the same user to write a program which both (a) specializes the
&gt; reasoning engine (b) provides input (models) to the reasoning engine.
&gt; This may be accomplished merely by subclassing a few well-chosen
&gt; classses, for instance. 
&gt; 
&gt; But lets bring the discussion back to SBML. At least my sense from
&gt; participating in the last meeting is that SBML is not about trying to
&gt; formalize such an API for different reasoners in the systems biology
&gt; domain (though that can be a very interesting task!). Instead there is
&gt; already a commitment to using an XML-based language, essentially as a
&gt; declarative representation for a notation intended primarily to
&gt; describe "subject domain" phenomena, i.e. pathways of interaction,
&gt; kinetics etc etc.
