&gt;Is this mentioned anywhere in the specification?

yes, see the last paragraph of section 3.1

&gt; 
&gt; I agree with John that IDs should be put into SBase with all the 
&gt; implications that this may have.
&gt; Leaving out IDs from units now will most probably lead to someone 
&gt; coming up with an example why units need IDs within two weeks 
&gt; after it 
&gt; was decided that they don't need any.
&gt; I also never saw the listOf.. structures as subclasses of SBase! Is 
&gt; this mentioned anywhere in the specification?

&gt; &gt; Okay, now I see why IDs shouldn't be put into SBase. :)
&gt; &gt; I'm actually in favor of it, too, but I'm betting a 
&gt; significant number 
&gt; &gt; of others won't be. So...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I guess minimally, for diagrams we could use ID fields in 
&gt; &gt; SpeciesReference, ModifierSpeciesReference and, possibly, 
&gt; KineticLaw. 
&gt; &gt; However, Unit already has name, and it is used as a primary key, so 
&gt; &gt; it's a very good candidate for an ID field--the only 
&gt; difference being 
&gt; &gt; that it must be unique across the whole model. Also, models will 
&gt; &gt; probably benefit from an ID field in the context of model 
&gt; composition 
&gt; &gt; (and from being required as opposed to optional).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; But, I see no reason at all for lists to have them (I didn't think 
&gt; &gt; about these structures being subclassed from  SBase), and I see no 
&gt; &gt; reason for &lt;unit&gt; or &lt;sbml&gt; elements to have them.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So maybe it would just be easier to go and stick them into 
&gt; everything 
&gt; &gt; that *needs* them?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; But, as I said, I actually lean toward sticking them into SBase.

&gt; &gt; 	Subject: Re: [sbml-discuss] DWG: multiple layouts
&gt; &gt; 	
&gt; &gt; 	
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 	  JWagner&gt; I don't see why SID isn't put into SBase (the
&gt; &gt; 	  JWagner&gt; primary key argument would imply it belongs
&gt; &gt; 	  JWagner&gt; here). I say let's put it into SBase in Level 2.
&gt; &gt; 	
&gt; &gt; 	I'm actually in favor of this.  (I assume also that this
&gt; &gt; 	would involve putting the 'name' field on SBase, since the
&gt; &gt; 	'id' and 'name' fields go hand in hand.)
&gt; &gt; 	
&gt; &gt; 	However, before doing this, everyone should think about some
&gt; &gt; 	of the implications:
&gt; &gt; 	
&gt; &gt; 	* The following substructures currently don't have ids or
&gt; &gt; 	  names because they are subordinate to other structures
&gt; &gt; 	  that *do* have ids.
&gt; &gt; 	
&gt; &gt; 	  - Unit
&gt; &gt; 	  - AlgebraicRule, AssignmentRule, RateRule
&gt; &gt; 	  - SpeciesReference, ModifierSpeciesReference
&gt; &gt; 	  - KineticLaw
&gt; &gt; 	  - EventAssignment
&gt; &gt; 	
&gt; &gt; 	  Remember that ids have to be unique across the whole
&gt; &gt; 	  model.  Under this proposed change to SBML, even unit
&gt; &gt; 	  definitions would have to have unique id's like this:
&gt; &gt; 	
&gt; &gt; 	   &lt;listOfUnitDefinitions id="u1"&gt;
&gt; &gt; 	       &lt;unitDefinition id="mmls"&gt;
&gt; &gt; 	           &lt;listOfUnits id="u2"&gt;
&gt; &gt; 	               &lt;unit id="u3" kind="mole"   scale="-3"/&gt;
&gt; &gt; 	               &lt;unit id="u4" kind="litre"  exponent="-1"/&gt;
&gt; &gt; 	               &lt;unit id="u5" kind="second" exponent="-1"/&gt;
&gt; &gt; 	           &lt;/listOfUnits&gt;
&gt; &gt; 	       &lt;/unitDefinition&gt;
&gt; &gt; 	   &lt;/listOfUnitDefinitions&gt;
&gt; &gt; 	
&gt; &gt; 	  Note the added id's on listOfUnitDefinitions, listOfUnits,
&gt; &gt; 	  and the &lt;unit...&gt; elements.  The point in particular is
&gt; &gt; 	  that nothing can refer to the &lt;unit ...&gt; elements, but
&gt; &gt; 	  this change to SBML would force software to generate the
&gt; &gt; 	  id's in some way.  Same for Rules, KineticLaw, etc.
&gt; &gt; 	  Further, it will bloat a model definition with more
&gt; &gt; 	  identifiers that have to be hashed and processed.
&gt; &gt; 	
&gt; &gt; 	
&gt; &gt; 	* If SBase included SId, then the listOf___s would also gain
&gt; &gt; 	  id and name fields.  But these correspond to array
&gt; &gt; 	  containers.  It seems strange to give ids and names to
&gt; &gt; 	  array containers.  (Admittedly, though, this has already
&gt; &gt; 	  happened with 'notes', 'annotation' and 'metaid'.)
&gt; &gt; 	
&gt; &gt; 	
&gt; &gt; 	* It is currently the case that SId is a required field in
&gt; &gt; 	  all places where is used, *except* on the Model structure,
&gt; &gt; 	  where it is only an optional field.  (The reason is simply
&gt; &gt; 	  that there's no construct within a model that can refer to
&gt; &gt; 	  the model's id, unlike the ids of species and other
&gt; &gt; 	  components.)  If SBase adopts SId, it would need 'id' to
&gt; &gt; 	  be required everywhere, including Model.
&gt; &gt; 	
&gt; &gt; 	
&gt; &gt; 	* The top-level Sbml structure (which defines the &lt;sbml ...&gt;
&gt; &gt; 	  tag) is currently also derived from SBase.  Under this
&gt; &gt; 	  proposal, it too would require an id, unless an exception
&gt; &gt; 	  were made.
&gt; &gt; 	
&gt; &gt; 	
&gt; &gt; 	There may be other interactions that haven't come to mind.
