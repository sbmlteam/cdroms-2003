Hello Tom,

Thank you for your paper.
It's a surprise!   Although our approaches are slightly different,  
I've been working on my multi-algorithm 'meta-algorithm' which can also be
used for Gillespie/ODE simulations these several years.

Your approach seems like well targeted to Gillespie/ODE hybrid simulations, and 
my impression is it would run efficiently.   I like its straightforward framework.

Some questions:

- I guess that you have used some polynomial interpolants to get dense output
  from Runge-Kutta, but how did you generate events with time-varying propensities?
  I couldn't get this very well because your paper has no equations..

- What type of scheduler did you use?   Is it exactly what you described in paper 6 of 
  the paper?

- What happens if the ODE part takes much smaller stepsize than Gillespie, or
  Gillespie's delta-t is very smaller than ODE?

- Can this be extended for parallel computers?


You may be interested in our paper on my algorithm too.    It is attached.
I didn't want to post a large file to everyone, but this is a small specialized group..

My algorithm provides a meta-algorithm based on a heap-tree event scheduler,
and Hermite polynomial interpolants.   It is intended to make it possible to employ
any simulation algorithms for sub-models (your paper also claims the same thing :).
We are now working on parallelization and dynamic switching between algorithms,
as well as usability improvements of E-Cell software itself.


regards,
-Kouichi


&gt; Thanks again Kouichi for your insight.  It is very useful to define what 
&gt; it is that we mean by "hybrid" and whether or not that should effect the 
&gt; definition of a model.
&gt; 
&gt; We have a system which we call "hybrid" as well.  I'm not sure by the 
&gt; definitions you give whether it falls into the mixed-mode or 
&gt; multi-algorithm category.
&gt; 
&gt; We assign the reactions in the model to be simulated using either a 
&gt; continuous method (ode's) or to be handled stochastically by a 
&gt; gillespie/gibson approach.   These methods run simultaneously and are 
&gt; synchronized by some scheme.  We also handle what could be called events 
&gt; and even delay differential equations.  Issues involved here include 
&gt; synchronization of time steps as well as state variables.
&gt; 
&gt; This assignment of reactions to "reaction engines" (that is the solution 
&gt; method) is done outside of sbml in our simulator's configuration file.  
&gt; Thus the model remains portable.  Also this allows us to run various 
&gt; experiments by changing the set of reactions assigned to each method.
&gt; 
&gt; Attached find a relatively recent version of a paper which we have 
&gt; submitted and revised for the journal Bioinformatics.
&gt; 
&gt; peace,
&gt; Tom
