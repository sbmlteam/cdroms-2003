I was refering to biochemical network simulators, I don't know the details 
for neuronal simulation tools, you're the expert there. Does Genesis 
check unit compatibility, I've no idea, I know you were involved in that 
project?

It has generally been the case that people in the biochemical modeling 
community pay personal attention to making sure that their units are 
compatible rather than letting the software do it. I'm not completely sure 
why this is (mainstream packages such as matlab etc don't do it), but 
there has never really been the need to build this sort of 
functionlity in to the software. One reason is that it's a complex 
problem, there are so many different ways that modelers can express 
their data, plus you can always give false information to the software and 
it will happily claim that everything is ok when in fact it's not, so at 
the end of the day I think a human touch is quite important in this 
particular area. I know that as a computer scientist it's a perfectly 
natural thing for you to suggest, i.e get the computer to do the work but
in this case I'm not sure if the perceived benfits are so clear cut. It 
could make matters worse by giving an inexperienced user a false sense 
of security. Stuff like derving equations etc is a well defined problem
so I don't think the issue arise there, but units, much more difficult.

I still stay that anyone who can't deal with units is probably not fit to
be a scientist, it is after all one of the most basic skills we all learn 
in our teens, that's brutal I know and many will not agree with me as
witnessed by some recent emails on the question of compartments.

Perhaps there can be some compromise, some contribution for software plus 
some human involvement but taking over the whole task is not an option. 
Checking an SBML file for unit compatibility could be helpful. Note that 
some models don't have any units, they'll have been normalised in some 
way.

&gt;   Herbert_Sauro&gt; I don't check if this is the case. As far
&gt;   Herbert_Sauro&gt; as I am aware all modeling tools do
&gt;   Herbert_Sauro&gt; this.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm aware of at least one tool that does check consistency
&gt; of units: NEURON, a neuronal simulation tool written by
&gt; Michael Hines and collaborators.
&gt; 
&gt; Despite that many (most?) tools don't do it, I think we can
&gt; all agree that it would be a benefit if tools did.  It's the
&gt; kind of thing that software should do.
