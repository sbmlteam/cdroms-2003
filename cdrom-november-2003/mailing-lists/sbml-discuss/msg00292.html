I don';t quite understand the argument in 1). Because the dimensions have no
units we have no idea how big the 200*50 node actually is, the user might
have drawn is as 200 meters by 50 meters (unlikely!). The 10pt font size
however has a physical size. I'm not sure how scaling can help because we
don't know by how much to scale unless you are implying that the dimensions
do have some units? The problem is we're mixing dimensionless units with
units with real units, I can't think at the moment of any way to relate them
with out making some assumption about the dimensionless units.

In your example I don't understand the scaling from 200*50 to 100*25 because
the font is 20pt? It looks like you're dividing by 2 and multiplying by 10
(in relation to the font size). The 20pt font is 20/72 inches high, however
we have no idea how high a 200 unit node is?
I'm missing something here I think, could you explain your approach a bit
more.

Subject: [sbml-discuss] DWG: SBML extension for layout 

1.) Units

Maybe we miss some point but in our opinion it should not be necessary
to specify units for diagrams. If all size constraints are specified
relative to each other the diagram (including fonts) can be scaled to
any resolution the user/application wants. Lets say we have a node as
a text label, then we could specify the size of the node as being 200
* 50 and the font being of size 20. Now, if we want to represent the
text label with a 10pt font, this would mean that the node would have
to be rescaled to have the size 100 * 25. If the application doesn't
want the font to scale with the rest of the diagram, the render
information for the font could e.g. include an attribute called
"fixed".


2.) SVG as layout format

When we first discussed creating a layout extension for SBML, we also
looked at SVG in order to store the pathway diagram/graph (that was
also a reason why we did not include a 3rd dimension in the first
draft). Finally, we dropped this alternative mainly because of the
following reason: SVG is a vector graphics format and not a graph
format. SVG does not allow to specify relations between objects as
would be needed e.g. by any (reaction) graph or network.


3.) Using SVG tags as render information

Although the complete SVG would probably be an overkill, we agree that
part of the SVG specification could be used as rendering
information(elements like e.g. circles, defs,...). One point that
should be considered is whether the individual SVG elements can easily
be extended to port 3D information or if we want to limit ourselfs to
2D rendering information.

4.) MathML rendering

There was the question whether there are any libraries that deal with
rendering MathML. So far the only free widget that we found is a GTK
widget(GtkMathView).
The alternative would be to convert the MathML to LaTeX, run LaTex and
convert the resulting DVI file to a bitmap file. For this there are
free tools, but no libraries.
For further tools see: <A  HREF="http://www.w3.org/Math/implementations.html">http://www.w3.org/Math/implementations.html</A>
