I vote for 1/72 pts per inch as the standard unit with the proviso (as I
indicated in an earlier email) that there be allowed an optional resolution
specifier in the header, eg perhaps someone (for what ever reason) wants to
specify the base units as say 300dpi.

As for the suggestion put forward by Eric Minch, this is a major
undertaking, not something we could sort out in the short term.

OK, now I guess I understand. The problem is, we tried to limit the 
layout information to the parts that are "absolutely" necessary which 
obviously did not include units as was pointed out by Herbert Sauro and 
John Wagner. I am not really sure, if we really have all the necessary 
bits and I hope that we will continue to get feedback about it.
Now some people start to miss bits that can be specified as 
"convenient". So we have to decide wether this information should 
really be put into the layout part, or if it would not better fit 
somewhere else like in the render information (to be specified) or the 
model itself.
I guess if units were to be put somewhere it would rather be in the 
layout part then in the render information, so if everybody could agree 
that having optional units specified for the layout information, we 
will put it there.
I also had a look at the SVG specification and they seem to use pixel 
as the standard unit if no other unit is specified. All measures in SVG 
can be given in different units. In my opinion this would be an 
overkill for SBML and I think it would be easiest to agree on the 
suggestion made by John Wagner to use 1/72 inch as the standard unit.
So what do others think? Should units be included or should we just 
agree that all values are 1/72 of an inch and if programs don't like 
that, they can do whatever they want? And if we want unit support, do 
people really need to be able to specify units in pt, mm, inch etc.?
As to the suggestion mad by Eric Minch on including information about 
the role of certain compounds, I personally think this information does 
not belong into the layout part. I think this should rather be put into 
the model if necessary (e.g. a new attribute in reaction that specifies 
wether this is a transport or an attribute in SpeciesReference that 
determines the role of the modifier (if it is used as one).
If this information is just used for rendering purposes, it should go 
with the render information.
Any thoughts on this?

&gt; No. They aren't absolutely necessary. They are, however,

&gt;
&gt; 	Maybe I am missing something here, but the point we are trying
to make
&gt; 	is that specifying units should not be necessary if all measures
are
&gt; 	given relative to each other. OK, I am going to try to explain
it in a
&gt; 	little more detail, maybe someone can tell me where I am wrong.
&gt; 	Lets assume, we have an sbml file with layout information and
the
&gt; 	largest x and y values are 2000,1500 respectively. And we also
have
&gt; 	some species reference that has a bounding box of size 200x70.
Now in
&gt; 	the render information of this bounding box, a font is specified
as
&gt; 	being of size 36 (which is just a relative size, not an absolute
one).
&gt; 	Now I have a program that needs to render this on screen and I
want
&gt; 	this font to be a 12pt font on the screen.
&gt; 	So the fontsize given as 36 would be equal to 12pt, this would
mean
&gt; 	that I just scale all the other values by 1/3, so on the screen
my
&gt; 	canvas would be 2000/3 x 1500/3 points and the bounding box of
the
&gt; 	species reference would be 200/3 x 70/3 point in size.
&gt; 	Now if for any reason I would decide that 12pt is to small and I
would
&gt; 	rather have an 18pt font, I would not divide be 3, but by 2.
&gt; 	The point is, I do not specify an absolute size for a font, but
a size
&gt; 	that is relative to the bounding box, so if I scale the whole
diagram,
&gt; 	the fonts scale (in theory) nicely as well. (Assuming, that you
don't
&gt; 	have to substitute fonts.)
&gt; 	We actually don't have any problem with specifying some unit in
the
&gt; 	file, we just don't understand the necessity for it.
&gt; 	I fear, that this explanation was not much better than the last
one,
&gt; 	but maybe someone can figure it out and tell me where I am
wrong.

&gt; 	&gt; I don';t quite understand the argument in 1). Because the
dimensions
&gt; 	&gt; have no
&gt; 	&gt; units we have no idea how big the 200*50 node actually is, the
user
&gt; 	&gt; might
&gt; 	&gt; have drawn is as 200 meters by 50 meters (unlikely!). The 10pt
font
&gt; 	&gt; size
&gt; 	&gt; however has a physical size. I'm not sure how scaling can help

&gt; because
&gt; 	&gt; we
&gt; 	&gt; don't know by how much to scale unless you are implying that
the
&gt; 	&gt; dimensions
&gt; 	&gt; do have some units? The problem is we're mixing dimensionless
units
&gt; 	&gt; with
&gt; 	&gt; units with real units, I can't think at the moment of any way
to
&gt; 	&gt; relate them
&gt; 	&gt; with out making some assumption about the dimensionless units.
&gt; 	&gt;
&gt; 	&gt; In your example I don't understand the scaling from 200*50 to
100*25
&gt; 	&gt; because
&gt; 	&gt; the font is 20pt? It looks like you're dividing by 2 and
multiplying
&gt; 	&gt; by 10
&gt; 	&gt; (in relation to the font size). The 20pt font is 20/72 inches
high,
&gt; 	&gt; however
&gt; 	&gt; we have no idea how high a 200 unit node is?
&gt; 	&gt; I'm missing something here I think, could you explain your
approach 
&gt; a
&gt; 	&gt; bit
&gt; 	&gt; more.

&gt; 	&gt;
&gt; 	&gt; 1.) Units
&gt; 	&gt;
&gt; 	&gt; Maybe we miss some point but in our opinion it should not be 
&gt; necessary
&gt; 	&gt; to specify units for diagrams. If all size constraints are
specified
&gt; 	&gt; relative to each other the diagram (including fonts) can be
scaled 
&gt; to
&gt; 	&gt; any resolution the user/application wants. Lets say we have a
node 
&gt; as
&gt; 	&gt; a text label, then we could specify the size of the node as
being 
&gt; 200
&gt; 	&gt; * 50 and the font being of size 20. Now, if we want to
represent the
&gt; 	&gt; text label with a 10pt font, this would mean that the node
would 
&gt; have
&gt; 	&gt; to be rescaled to have the size 100 * 25. If the application
doesn't
&gt; 	&gt; want the font to scale with the rest of the diagram, the
render
&gt; 	&gt; information for the font could e.g. include an attribute
called
&gt; 	&gt; "fixed".
&gt; 	&gt;
&gt; 	&gt;
&gt; 	&gt; 2.) SVG as layout format
&gt; 	&gt;
&gt; 	&gt; When we first discussed creating a layout extension for SBML,
we 
&gt; also
&gt; 	&gt; looked at SVG in order to store the pathway diagram/graph
(that was
&gt; 	&gt; also a reason why we did not include a 3rd dimension in the
first
&gt; 	&gt; draft). Finally, we dropped this alternative mainly because of
the
&gt; 	&gt; following reason: SVG is a vector graphics format and not a
graph
&gt; 	&gt; format. SVG does not allow to specify relations between
objects as
&gt; 	&gt; would be needed e.g. by any (reaction) graph or network.
&gt; 	&gt;
&gt; 	&gt;
&gt; 	&gt; 3.) Using SVG tags as render information
&gt; 	&gt;
&gt; 	&gt; Although the complete SVG would probably be an overkill, we
agree 
&gt; that
&gt; 	&gt; part of the SVG specification could be used as rendering
&gt; 	&gt; information(elements like e.g. circles, defs,...). One point
that
&gt; 	&gt; should be considered is whether the individual SVG elements
can 
&gt; easily
&gt; 	&gt; be extended to port 3D information or if we want to limit
ourselfs 
&gt; to
&gt; 	&gt; 2D rendering information.
&gt; 	&gt;
&gt; 	&gt; 4.) MathML rendering
&gt; 	&gt;
&gt; 	&gt; There was the question whether there are any libraries that
deal 
&gt; with
&gt; 	&gt; rendering MathML. So far the only free widget that we found is
a GTK
&gt; 	&gt; widget(GtkMathView).
&gt; 	&gt; The alternative would be to convert the MathML to LaTeX, run
LaTex 
&gt; and
&gt; 	&gt; convert the resulting DVI file to a bitmap file. For this
there are
&gt; 	&gt; free tools, but no libraries.
&gt; 	&gt; For further tools see:
