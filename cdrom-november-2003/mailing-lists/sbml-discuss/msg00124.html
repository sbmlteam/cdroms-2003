I'm not making any firm judgment yet on the choice of MathML, I'm still on
the fence on this one, I'm a little bit suspicious I guess because I'm
unfamiliar with programming to it. Parsing infix is very easy, it's a first
year undergrad problem. I think I would agree (thought I've not tried
myself) that parsing MathML should be even easier, however most simulators
allow users to enter infix expressions, on output these must be converted to
MathML and of course when read back in, the MathML must be converted back to
infix (for the user to see). One issue with the conversion to infix is
bracketing, the naive approach is to bracket everything in which case the
user will see a significant change in the appearance of their infix
expressions, particularly a problem I think with script based simulators.
There must be some effort to make sure that the infix expressions that users
enter come back to them as unaltered as possible I think.

One other think worth noting is that SBML Level 1 is very easy to edit and
I've found myself on a number of occasions editing the SBML directly,
especially the rates laws (XML is human readable), this is very useful. With
SBML Level 2 this won't be so easy.

Although MathML obviously has it's advantages (easier to parse than infix,
defined set of symbols) we should also be aware of it's disadvantages and
try to reduce the impact of these on the developer and user. It is the
developers of SBML libraries who have this responsibility (lucky me I'm not
one of them!) and we as arm-chair developers (speaking for myself in this
case) should be careful not to load the developers with needless tasks
unless we're sure that payback is well worth it.

I'm currently on the fence with respect to MathML, there are advantages and
disadvantages and I can't quite make up my mind yet whether we're getting
something worth while or not, hence it will be interesting to see how it
goes over the next year or so. 

Ben may have a lot of experience with parsing MathML and it would be worth
hearing from him on this. As I said I've zero experience with writing
software to read and write MathML so I'm not the one to talk, but it is
worth pointing out some of the issues I've raised.

As for an alternative, I don't have one other than infix which probably
isn't a good answer. But users understand it and the majority of our tools
can happily read and write it now.

I would contend there is some experience about using MathML "in the wild"
from a development perspective.  It's about the same as any reasonably
facile, prefix based syntax for expressions, namely significant, but
much simpler than infix expressions with the same expressiveness.

What would you propose using instead of MathML for expressions?
Simple expression syntaxes have a way of evolving into not-so-simple,
customized, expression syntaxes and these are always more difficult
to maintain because they require a more specialized body of knowledge
about the implementation.

Marc Vass may also want to comment on his experience building a level
2 compatible processor and the impact MathML has on its complexity.

&gt; I may not agree with the explicit and mandatory specification of the unit
&gt; volume compartment in all models (although I abide by the community
&gt; decision) I do agree with Pedro's sentiments with respect to letting these
&gt; standards live a life first in the real world before they get cast into
&gt; stone. For example, let's see how the use of MathML in Level 2 turns out,
it
&gt; may or may not be the best route to take, we don't actually know how it
will
&gt; turn out since none of us have tried to use it in the wild (so to speak).
&gt; Perhaps MathML might turn out too be expensive to support in terms of
&gt; programming cost, both development and maintenance. I know Ben is writing
a
&gt; MathML reader/writer, but once he has gone who maintains it, it's not as
if
&gt; we have a vibrant open-source comp bio community which contributes code or
&gt; modifies existing code, quite the opposite in fact.
&gt;
&gt; There are still issues in level 1 that haven't been resolved and at the
&gt; moment we're managing to get models portable between tools because the
&gt; authors of the tools have agreed to use Level 1 in a certain way which may
&gt; or may not follow the strict guidelines in the level 1 document.
&gt;
&gt; I am aware however of the urgency in setting the standard, I know there
are
&gt; many pressures to get the standard out asap.

&gt;
&gt; Mike &amp; Andrew,
&gt;
&gt; I support the analysis you made and therefore the conclusion.
&gt;
&gt; This discussion brings up an issue that has been dormant (but here!) since
&gt; the
&gt; freeze of level 1 version 1: the need for a longer period of time between
&gt; deciding on features and actually freezing (publishing) the specification.
&gt; When
&gt; I and Herbert were working on making existing software import/export SBML
&gt; level
&gt; 1 we discovered a number of features that could have been decided in a
&gt; better
&gt; way, and others that were missing. While you made a very good analysis of
&gt; the
&gt; problem of default compartments, it is easy to miss out important
&gt; consequences
&gt; from such analyses. I propose that the next specs be accepted first as
draft
&gt;
&gt; for a considerable period of time (say 1 year), and then adjusted
according
&gt; to
&gt; feedback from those who have been implementing for the draft. It would
also
&gt; be
&gt; important to publish reference software that demonstrates use of the
&gt; standard.
&gt; This procedure would ensure that we iron out problems with the standards.
&gt; Given
&gt; that we already have a standard for the most common features of models, we
&gt; should be careful to get the standard right for the features that are only
&gt; now
&gt; being thought of (ie most simulators do not implement them yet, in some
&gt; cases
&gt; none)
