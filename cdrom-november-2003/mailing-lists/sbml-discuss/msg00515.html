Dear Wayne,

I would like to join the SBML spatial features working group.
I have been working on modeling and simulation analysis of chromosome
dynamics from mechanical viewpoint. It is would be really exciting to
define the spatial modeling properties on SBML so that more physical
modeling and simulation software could be developed to connect with SBW
via SBML. My knowledge on mechanical modeling might be of your help.

Thanks, 
Mineo

&gt; Wayne and colleagues,
&gt; 
&gt; (1) I'd like to join the the SBML spatial features working group.  I'm not
&gt; currently a member of any of the sbml listservs but if there is a specific
&gt; list for the spatial group please put me on it (dean@dbottino.com ;
&gt; dbottino@physiome.com ).
&gt; 
&gt; (2) Suggestions for chairs:  John Wagner and Jim Schaff have both a user and
&gt; developer perspective on what I consider to be 'classical' spatial modeling
&gt; application in computational cell biology, in which the species are treated
&gt; as concentration fields on a spatial domain. In addition Virtual Cell has a
&gt; clever separation between the reaction and spatial models which I would like
&gt; to see supported by sbml in the future.
&gt; 
&gt; My own interest is as a systems biology software user rather than a
&gt; developer.  I have spent some time at Physiome evaluating spatial modeling
&gt; functionality of various biomodeling software packages.  I have ongoing
&gt; research in the area of spatial intracellular signaling applied to cell
&gt; motility and chemotaxis. I've written some of my own solvers and am aware of
&gt; the dire need for a software-independent language for model description.
&gt; I'd be happy to offer suggestions from this particular user perspective.
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you,
&gt; Dean Bottino

&gt; Dean, you may have interest in the activities of the SBML group engaged in
&gt; spatial modeling interests?

&gt; Subject: [sbml-discuss] SPATIAL - Spatial Features Working Group
&gt; 
&gt;      At the recent SBML Forum I ended up volunteering to be the person to
&gt; email the general announcement regarding formation of the SBML Spatial
&gt; Features working group, since one of the models we are concerned with (the
&gt; 4D Chromosome folding model) deals with spatial features (and time courses)
&gt; 
&gt; exclusively with no use if I understand it correctly of reaction lists.
&gt; 
&gt;      I did not volunteer to chair or co-chair this group, so the first
&gt; order of business is for someone with broader interests in this area to
&gt; step forward to chair the group and put together a better charter than I
&gt; would be able to compose.  I gather from the presentations made at the
&gt; Spatial Modeling breakout session in the subsequent BioSPICE meeting that
&gt; there are modelers who work with reaction lists who wish to consider
&gt; spatial issues in describing some reactions.  When I asked about how much
&gt; interest they had in distance limits between pairs of species, which is
&gt; central to our needs, that sounded pretty peripheral to their main
&gt; interests.  I believe the chief overlap between their spatial concerns and
&gt; ours is the ability we both would use to designate the XYZ coordinates of
&gt; a species (in time and space).
&gt; 
&gt;      I imagine our interest in distance bounds in our 4D Chromosome
&gt; folding model will likely be addressed most effectively in the Constraints
&gt; working group, but we will also have interest in methods for representing
&gt; locations of species that are likely to be developed in the context of
&gt; the spatial features working group.
&gt; 
&gt;      The people who signed up for the Spatial Features group at the SBML
&gt; Forum are
&gt; 
&gt;     Greg Peterson 	gdp@utk.edu
&gt;     Mike McCollum	jmccoll2@utk.edu
&gt;     Daniel Lucio	lucio@adp.uchc.edu
&gt;     Akira Funahashi	funa@symbio.jst.go.jp
&gt;     Takeshi Sakurada	sakurada@sfc.keio.ac.jp
&gt;     Jim Schaff		schaff@neuron.uchc.edu
&gt;     Steve Burbeck	sburbeck@us.ibm.com
&gt;     Michael Hucka	mhucka@caltech.edu
&gt;     Poul Nielsen	p.nielsen@auckland.ac.nz
&gt;     Vijay Saraswat	saraswat@cse.psu.edu
&gt;     Wayne Rindone	wrindone@arep.med.harvard.edu
&gt;     John Wagner		jwagner@nso.uchc.edu
&gt; 
&gt;     In addition, I hope that the two people who presented their interests
&gt; in representing models with spatial features at the BioSPICE meeting
&gt; breakout meeting on that topic will be interested in participate in
&gt; helping the SBML community in designing how to represent such features. 
&gt; They are welcome to indicate their interest in this working group by an
&gt; email to sbml-discuss@caltech.edu (likewise anyone else not already listed
&gt; above who wishes to participate).  A similar email from someone willing to
&gt; chair this group, whether already listed or not, would also be most
&gt; welcome.
&gt; 
&gt;      The two BioSPICE folk who made presentations at the Spatial Features
&gt; breakout were
&gt; 
&gt;      Andrzej Przekwas		ajp@cfdrc.com
&gt;      Phil Colella		PColella@lbl.gov
&gt; 
&gt;      I will be happy to participate in forming this group and in its
&gt; discussions, but I should let people know that between June 24 and July 9
&gt; I will be traveling in Sweden, visiting friends and relatives, and will
&gt; only have minimal sporadic access to reading or responding to email.
