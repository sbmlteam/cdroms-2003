My opinion is unchanged:

The species symbol should represent concentrations, as it is specified 
in L1.

The Confusion over my opinion arose because I also stated that I prefer 
that the units of species are units of amount, not concentration, 
regardless of whether initialConcentration or initialAmount is given.

In the way things are stated in L2V1Final Draft, the interpretation of 
the attribute "units" to &lt;species&gt; changes depending whether the 
attribute "initialAmount" is present or the attribute 
"initialConcentration" is present. So I prefer the "units" in &lt;species&gt;
to refer to the symbol, not the numerical value appearing as initial 
condition. A second problem with the current definition arises for 
sepcies that do have units, but do not have an initial value (e.g., 
because they are controlled by a rule).

To summarize my position:

(1) Species symbols appearing in rate laws are CONCENTRATIONS.

(2) "units" definitions in &lt;species&gt; set the units of AMOUNT.

(3) "initialAmount" is in the units of the species amount.

(4) "initialConcentration" is in units of AMOUNT/VOLUME, where AMOUNT 
are the units of the species, and VOLUME are the units of the 
compartment volume for the enclosing compartment.

Points (1), (2), (3) are as in Level 1 and in L2 Draft3.
Points (2), (3), and (4) are different from the current FINAL DRAFT.


Regarding the equations below: The first formula is correct, but does 
not capture the problem fully. In SBML we do not specify the rate 
equation directly, but only the contribution of each reaction. In 
assembling the rate eqaution, these contributions are collected for all 
reactions affecting a species. To illustrate the problem, I use a 
simplified system:

R1: A -&gt; B with rate k1 (in 1/second)
R2: B -&gt; C with rate k2 (in 1/second)

Each species in a separate volume Va, Vb, Vc.
I use A,B,C for amounts, [A], [B], [C] for concentrations (A=[A]*Va).

(AA) The reactions are in terms of amounts only (AA=Amount Amount):

dA/dt = - k1 A
dB/dt =   k1 A  - k2 B
dC/dt =           k2 B

(CC) In terms of concentrations only:

d[A]/dt = 1/Va (- k1 [A]*Va )             = - k1 [A]
d[B]/dt = 1/Vb (  k1 [A]*Va  - k2 [B]*Vb )=   k1 [A]*Va/Vb -k2 [B]
d[C]/dt = 1/Vc (               k2 [B]*Vb )=                 k2 [B]*Vb/Vc

(AC) In terms of amounts on the LHS and concentrations on the RHS:

dA/dt = (- k1 [A]*Va )             = - k1 [A]*Va
dB/dt = (  k1 [A]*Va  - k2 [B]*Vb )=   k1 [A]*Va - k2 [B]*Vb
dC/dt = (               k2 [B]*Vb )=               k2 [B]*Vb

(CA) In terms of concentrations on the LHS and amounts on the RHS:

d[A]/dt = 1/Va (- k1 A )        = - k1 A/Va
d[B]/dt = 1/Vb (  k1 A  - k2 B )=   k1 A/Vb - k2 B/Vb
d[C]/dt = 1/Vc (          k2 B )=             k2 B/Vc


We see that the first formula of Mike below is correct, while the second 
is incorrect.

 &gt;    d[B]/dt = k1*A/Va - k2*B/Vb

Now remember that we specify rection rates, not the complete rate laws. 
Therefore only those choices are candidates, for which a reaction always 
appears with the same term in the rate laws. This is only the case for
(AA) and (AC), see the last columns (when a mono-spaced font is used, 
corresponding terms line up).

The reason for choosing (AC) instead of (AA) was probably that enzymatic 
rates mostly use parameters in terms of concentrations, for which AC 
would look better. The same goes for higher order reactions. The first 
order reactions used here are an exception in that the rate constant is 
the same for formulas (AA) and (CC) if the volumes are all equal. For 
higher order reactions and Michaelis-menten type rates, this is not the 
case, and those rates are usually specified in terms of concentrations.

&gt; People,
&gt; 
&gt; I confess I've become confused over what people want to see
&gt; as far as species units.  After rereading the many messages
&gt; about this on sbml-discuss, and comparing this to what we
&gt; just wrote in the L2 final draft spec, it's no longer clear
&gt; to me how people want to interpret the appearance of a
&gt; species symbol in a math expression.  Should it be a number
&gt; in units of substance, or in units of concentration?
&gt; 
&gt; Note that this is separate from the question of what the
&gt; initial value for a species should be (people want the
&gt; option of using either concentration or substance) and also
&gt; the question of what the reaction rate expression should be
&gt; (people want substance/time, not concentration/time).  I
&gt; think those questions are settled at this point.
&gt; 
&gt; In the spec as written, we wrote that species identifiers in
&gt; math expressions stand for the quantity of that species in
&gt; terms of CONCENTRATION units.  However, Joerg Weimar's
&gt; recent feedback, and a number of past messages on
&gt; sbml-discuss, make it seem that perhaps it should be in
&gt; SUBSTANCE units.
&gt; 
&gt; Using substance units would appear to be more consistent
&gt; with having reaction rates be in terms of substance/time.
&gt; One could generate concentrations by dividing species by the
&gt; compartments in which they're located.  So if one has two
&gt; reactions, A -&gt; B + C and B -&gt; D, with the former having a
&gt; rate of "k1*A" and the latter "k2*B" (where "A" and "B"
&gt; represent substance amounts), and each species is located in
&gt; separate compartments with volumes Va, Vb, Vc, and Vd, then
&gt; the rate of change in amount of B would be
&gt; 
&gt;    dB/dt = k1*A - k2*B
&gt; 
&gt; and the rate of change of concentration in B would be
&gt; 
&gt;    d[B]/dt = k1*A/Va - k2*B/Vb
&gt; 
&gt; Is that right?  Does that work for more complicated cases?
&gt; 
&gt; I'm sorry to bring this up.  I hope this is a simple
&gt; question and people can just tell me it's obvious that we're
&gt; going one way or the other.
