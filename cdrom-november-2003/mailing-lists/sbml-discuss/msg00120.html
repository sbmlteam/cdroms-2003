Everyone,

Thank you for all the discussions surrounding the
default/no-default compartments issue.  We really appreciate
the wonderful level of participation and effort that you,
the SBML community, have shown.

We would like to close the matter of whether to make
compartments be optional in SBML.  Eric Minch pointed out
problems with the statistical significance of the survey
results that we had not considered (thanks, Eric).  On the
other hand, we are faced with the problem of having to make
*some* sort of decision.

Cliff put forward a cogent argument from the viewpoint that
SBML Level 1 was intended to be an intersection of features
needed by a variety of simulation tools.  For those models
that don't require a compartment, it seems wrong to require
them to define essentially a fake compartment. 

On the other hand, we need to watch out for issues of
logical consistency in the language.  It turns out that
allowing compartments to be optional leads to a greater
number of potential ambiguities than making compartments
mandatory.  Here is a sample of possible ambiguities and
logical inconsistencies that would result:

1) If a compartment is optional, then the 'compartment'
   attribute on a species definition necessarily must also
   be optional.  As someone pointed out during the survey,
   this leads to the possibility that a model could have
   some species defined with a compartment attribute and
   some without.  The interpretation of this is unclear.

2) At the last SBML Forum meeting, people generally wanted
   to move away from having default quantities in SBML and
   instead have SBML define missing values as "unknown".  As
   someone pointed out during the survey, compartments are
   structural features of models and not quantities per se.
   However, if compartments are made optional, then a
   missing compartment in a model definition would imply
   that a default compartment should be assumed, which in
   turn would logically require that the default compartment
   have a default volume.  This would constitute introducing
   a default quantity.

3) In the near future, the community hopes to be able to
   compose models out of multiple other models.  If
   compartments were made optional and some model (call it
   "A") did not specify any explicit compartment, it would
   lead to the following difficulty.  If an enclosing model
   attempted to use model "A" as part of a larger model, and
   it needed to link or refer to the compartment in "A",
   then it would not be able to use the compartment name or
   id in "A" (because there would not be any).  Working
   around this would require either adding default
   compartment names to go along with default compartments,
   or introducing some sort of special case for composing
   models out of submodels lacking compartments.  Both of
   these alternatives would increase complexity compared to
   simply making compartments mandatory.
   
There are other issues, but the general result seems to be
that, although there are undeniably good arguments for
having default compartments, on balance, there are more
reasons to *avoid* default compartments.

Thus, the conclusion appears to be that Level 1 version 2
and Level 2 should make compartments mandatory.
