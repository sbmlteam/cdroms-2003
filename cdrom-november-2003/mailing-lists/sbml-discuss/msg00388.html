Hi Cliff,

      I mostly agree with your suggestion (with a minor hypothetical
quibble).  It does not seem necessary to immediately invalidate previously
valid SBMl level 2 models (like the current incarnation of the E coli flux
balance model) where the denominator field was used.  And I gather from
some of the discussion on this issue that stochastic modelers might wish
for separate numerator and denominator values with a meaning not related
to trying to represent a non-integer stoichimetry that is not amenable to
exact representation in a single number (like 2/3).

      For every flux reaction stoichiometry that I have seen a simple
float number is perfectly adequate (and more natural than the denominators
I had to use), but I can imagine having a fractional stoichiometry like
2/3 where for that stoichimetry and no others one might wish to use the
precise fraction.  So I do not think it necessary to limit all
stoichiometries in a given model to provide denominators in all cases or
in no cases.

      But we all understand that in the future we need to have a way to
designate what sort of model a given SBML document represents.  I expect
the way for doing this will come from the work of the Controlled
Vocabulary working group (anyone else notice that was left out of the list
in the meeting minutes, although it showed up with Mike Hucka in charge in
a separate listing of all the working groups that was posted?).  Perhaps
the reaction type working group will also think about this, but in terms
of the flux balance model, I can imagine classifying reactions as either
metabolic or transport, it is the type of the model (rather than the
reaction type) that indicates reactions contain flux limits rather than
rate equations and/or amounts or concentrations.

&gt; Given that we need a quick resolution to these issues, and given that
&gt; there was not a clear consensus on stoichiometries, let me lay out what I
&gt; think we need to do and why.
&gt; 
&gt; If I understand things correctly, we have different modelers with
&gt; different needs, as follows:
&gt; 
&gt; a) integer stoichiometries (integer in numerator)
&gt; b) rational stoichiometries (integers in numerator and denominator)
&gt; c) real stoichiometries (floating point in numerator)
&gt; d) a variable name for the stoichiometry, whose value is defined
&gt;    elsewhere, whose result could be any of the above
&gt; e) an expression for the stoichiometry, whose result could be any of the
&gt;    above
&gt; 
&gt; Did I miss anything?
&gt; 
&gt; Now the point is that different modelers need different things. To express
&gt; these different things, at the physical level it looks like a hodge-podge
&gt; of fields. But the fact is that, for example, nobody needs a floating
&gt; point numerator AND an integer denominator (for example). Am I right?
&gt; 
&gt; For the immediate decision, I think its clear that we need to permit the
&gt; full flexibility necessary at a physical level to support the various
&gt; logical expressions represented by a-c. That means we definately need
&gt; floating point numerators and (optional) integer denominators. The only
&gt; interesting debate I see is whether we go further and permit IDs or even
&gt; expressions. For the immediate future (i.e., deciding by June 1), I don't
&gt; care all that much whether we permit IDs and expressions, though I think
&gt; an ID would be nice. For the longer term (meaning for a FUTURE release),
&gt; its clear to me that many of the problems will resolve themselves once we
&gt; have the ability to declare model types or features. In the future, models
&gt; should be declared such that its clear whether they have rational
&gt; stoichiometries OR floating point stoichiometries, and that it WILL be an
&gt; either/or situation for any given model.
