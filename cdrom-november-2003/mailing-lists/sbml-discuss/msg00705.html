If you agree with Andrew's definition, how are you going to model systems like glycolysis, many eukaryotic signaling pathways, etc?

onthegenerated SBML model



I would like to exemplify another existing practice in E-Cell
Version 3, but before that let me say the conclusions first, because
some of people here won't be interested in E-Cell's specific data
structure.

- I still like the original definition by Andrew:

&gt; A modifier, as the standard is written, is a species that affects the
&gt; reaction,
&gt; but is not a product or reactant of the reaction.
  
  I do not have any strong opinion about whether a reactant/product can
   also be a modifier or not.   But I think it is dependent on how
   the model is constructed, especially the rate law, and the structure
   and the dynamics of the model should be independent as far as
   possible. The Andrew's definition above is good to this end because
   it is clear and simple.

  If it is decided that a reactant/product can also be a modifier,
   E-Cell's SBML importer would ignore the modifier that is also a
   reactant/product, because unlike SBML it does have a single list
   of species (see below).

- I agree that in SBML it should be more useful to be able to mark up
   each species reference's role.



E-Cell 3's structure is somewhat similar to Gepasi, which is like:

(Pedro's comment:)
&gt; And in Gepasi this is easy to do since the *species roles* are
&gt; separated from the *species* in the rate laws (the more I see these
&gt; discussions the more I like toi have made this choice!) This means that
&gt; rate laws are defined with symbols that are not the species names. Then
&gt; the species are assigned to those symbols that are substrates, products
&gt; and modifiers. This lets me write a rate law such as: V*S/(K+S+M)  and
&gt; then assign the same species to S and M. It is the symbols S and M that
&gt; are labeled as substrate and modifier, not the species that is assigned to
&gt; them (which in this case has both roles). 


In addition, unlike the previous versions of E-Cell, it does not have
separate lists for substrates, products and modifiers.   Instead, it has a
single list of 'VariableReferences'.    

Each instance of VariableReference has the following fields:

- a reference name (this is like 'V', 'S' and 'M' in the Pedro's example)
- an ID of a variable in the model
- an integer coefficient
- an 'accessor' flag

If the 'coefficient' is negative, it indicates that it is decreased
in forward occurrences of the 'Process' (an object representing 
a type of phenomenon in the model such as a reaction).   If the Process
is a reaction-Process, then it is a substrate.   If the coefficient
is plus, it is a product.   If it is zero, then the Process can use
its value to calculate something, but is not changed by this Process 
(read-only).    

The Process identifies variables either by the reference names or
coefficients.   For example, it can just get the value of the variable
whose reference name is 'S0', OR, it can also get all the references
with negative coefficients and take a product of these values 
(i.e. mass-action).   That is, the role and meaning of each reference is 
not determined by the model itself, but by each specific implementation
of the Process object class.  Such information about the specification
of each Process class is exported to be used by modeling software.
For example, some Processes may define 'E' as the enzyme and 'S0' as
the first substrate.

The 'accessor flag' indicates if the Process reads the value of
the variable to determine its behavior.   If this is false,
it means that the Process object does not use the value of this
variable. This flag is meaningful only when the coefficient is non-zero.
This information is used mainly in multi-algorithm
(multi-stepper) environments for synchronization between sub-models.


This cannot be directly compared to SBML because this is a very lower
level semantics.  Unlike SBML it does not discriminate between chemical
reactions and other phenomena and rules.     Our decision was to use
a single pair of objects (Variable and Process) to represent everything.
This is to make it as generic as possible because we need to face the
ontological complexity of cell biology.
In SBML there are rules, reactions, events, and the number is still
growing.    This difference is quite understandable because SBML is a 
language and E-Cell is a simulator.
