I may not agree with the explicit and mandatory specification of the unit
volume compartment in all models (although I abide by the community
decision) I do agree with Pedro's sentiments with respect to letting these
standards live a life first in the real world before they get cast into
stone. For example, let's see how the use of MathML in Level 2 turns out, it
may or may not be the best route to take, we don't actually know how it will
turn out since none of us have tried to use it in the wild (so to speak).
Perhaps MathML might turn out too be expensive to support in terms of
programming cost, both development and maintenance. I know Ben is writing a
MathML reader/writer, but once he has gone who maintains it, it's not as if
we have a vibrant open-source comp bio community which contributes code or
modifies existing code, quite the opposite in fact.

There are still issues in level 1 that haven't been resolved and at the
moment we're managing to get models portable between tools because the
authors of the tools have agreed to use Level 1 in a certain way which may
or may not follow the strict guidelines in the level 1 document.

I am aware however of the urgency in setting the standard, I know there are
many pressures to get the standard out asap.

Mike &amp; Andrew,

I support the analysis you made and therefore the conclusion. 

This discussion brings up an issue that has been dormant (but here!) since
the 
freeze of level 1 version 1: the need for a longer period of time between 
deciding on features and actually freezing (publishing) the specification.
When 
I and Herbert were working on making existing software import/export SBML
level 
1 we discovered a number of features that could have been decided in a
better 
way, and others that were missing. While you made a very good analysis of
the 
problem of default compartments, it is easy to miss out important
consequences 
from such analyses. I propose that the next specs be accepted first as draft

for a considerable period of time (say 1 year), and then adjusted according
to 
feedback from those who have been implementing for the draft. It would also
be 
important to publish reference software that demonstrates use of the
standard. 
This procedure would ensure that we iron out problems with the standards.
Given 
that we already have a standard for the most common features of models, we 
should be careful to get the standard right for the features that are only
now 
being thought of (ie most simulators do not implement them yet, in some
cases 
none)
