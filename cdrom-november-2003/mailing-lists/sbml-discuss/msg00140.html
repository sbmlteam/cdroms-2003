I would urge the authors to include an explicit section up-front 
detailing the "design goals of SBML". In particular the goals should 
provide some background

For reference, the section from the XML standard document on the goals 
of XML is included below.

Additionally, particularly for the computer scientists who we hope will 
read this document and participate in SBML model development/tool 
building, it would really help to make explicit (perhaps in an 
introductory section) some of the underlying assumed background 
knowledge (some say: "ontological commitments") around concepts such as 
"compartments", "reactions", "species", "rules" etc. Often such 
background discussions are extremely helpful in making the document much 
more widely accessible, and in uncovering missing 
assumptions/inconsistent assumptions in one's thinking.

In particular, I think the notion of compartment is actually quite 
delicate, and deserves a careful and thorough treatment. Do reactions 
happen "in" compartments? "across" compartments? Both? Isnt flux 
important then? I think these are central issues (they came up in 
discussion yesterday) and need to be dealt with head-on.

Some folks may be interested in looking at Luca Cardelli's notion of 
ambients for related ideas.

Best,
Vijay

====================================================================

XML was developed by an XML Working Group (originally known as the SGML 
Editorial Review Board) formed under the auspices of the World Wide Web 
Consortium (W3C) in 1996. It was chaired by Jon Bosak of Sun 
Microsystems with the active participation of an XML Special Interest 
Group (previously known as the SGML Working Group) also organized by the 
W3C. The membership of the XML Working Group is given in an appendix. 
Dan Connolly served as the WG's contact with the W3C.

The design goals for XML are:

XML shall be straightforwardly usable over the Internet.

XML shall support a wide variety of applications.

XML shall be compatible with SGML.

It shall be easy to write programs which process XML documents.

The number of optional features in XML is to be kept to the absolute 
minimum, ideally zero.

XML documents should be human-legible and reasonably clear.

The XML design should be prepared quickly.

The design of XML shall be formal and concise.

XML documents shall be easy to create.

Terseness in XML markup is of minimal importance.
