I finally have a few minutes to type out my initial
thoughts about the EML group's latest efforts. They
have been working very hard on this layout stuff!
Anyway, nothing earth-shattering here, just some
minor points...

0. With a few exceptions, SBML does not use abbreviations.
Abbreviations are a Bad Idea, because they rarely make sense
to anyone but the person who thought them up in the first
place. So, I would change the "GR" and "GRs" to something
more intuitive; I like "Glyph" and "Glyphs".
1. In SBML, things like reactants and products, in referencing
other things like species, use an attribute name that is specific
to their context. For example, a speciesReference element has
a "species" attribute to refer to a species. The layout markup
should follow this approach. Specifically:
	* &lt;compartmentGR id="cGR1" compartment="c1" ... /&gt;
	* &lt;speciesGR id="sGR1" species="s1" ... /&gt;
	* &lt;reactionGR id="rGR1" reaction="r1" ... /&gt;
	* &lt;speciesReferenceGR id="sRGR1" speciesGR="sGR1" ... /&gt;
Consistency begets clarity, beauty, and all sorts of other
wonderful nouns.
2. The whole "role" stuff in speciesReferenceGR elements seems
a bit vague and misplaced to me, and unless someone can explain
how a graphical representation has a "role" in another graphical
representation (as is suggested by their verbiage)--especially
given roles like "product" or "substrate", which are chemical
roles rather than visual, graphical representation roles--I
would like to see this overhauled. That is, these are either
visual entities, or they are chemistry. If they are visual
entities, then the attribute names (and roles themselves)
should be given names reflecting this. If they are chemistry,
then they should be moved to model section; in that case, my
initial reaction would be to make speciesReferenceGR elements
specifically reference the speciesReference that they are
visually representing, and then put the role info in the
speciesReference elements. IN ANY CASE, a lot of the "role"
stuff seems incredibly redundant and vague, and belongs
(and indeed, already exists) elsewhere.

I also agree with Herbert et al about line placement, but we
need to think pretty hard about it so that everyone is happy.
For example, JDesigner (as I recall) doesn't have a
graphical representation for the reaction; instead, the
reaction is represented by the collection of lines in
an implicit manner. On the other hand, the Virtual Cell
group takes an approach similar to the EML approach, with
two (x, y) points representing the reaction (one point
where reactants hook in, one where products hook in).
I think we need to treat both approaches.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; We finally finished to put the suggestion Sven made a few weeks ago 
&gt; into words.
&gt; 
&gt; <A  HREF="http://projects.eml.org/bcb/sbml/level1/">http://projects.eml.org/bcb/sbml/level1/</A>
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The major updates to the last proposal are:
&gt; 
&gt; - based upon SBML Level 2
&gt; - layout information was seperated from the model definition
&gt; - all objects are based on SBase to be able to specify metainformation
&gt; 
&gt; On our website you can read the document online or download a pdf 
&gt; version. We also put up the schema definition and a small sample file.
&gt; 
&gt; Since there are not going to be IDs on all objects in SBML Level 2, 
&gt; referencing SpeciesReferences is still somewhat awkward.
&gt; 
&gt; An alternative to the mode for referencing SpeciesReferences in this 
&gt; proposal would be to use the metaids  for referencing.
&gt; Actually I was kind of wondering why there was the need to have an 
&gt; additional ID on some objects. Could not the metaid be used for both 
&gt; purposes, identifying objects as well as reference point for 
&gt; metainformation?  Maybe I missed something there?
&gt; Again, we would like to get as much feedback as possible in  order to 
&gt; further improve on this layout information proposal.
