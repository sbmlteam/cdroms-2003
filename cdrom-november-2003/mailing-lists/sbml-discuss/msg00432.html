People,

I confess I've become confused over what people want to see
as far as species units.  After rereading the many messages
about this on sbml-discuss, and comparing this to what we
just wrote in the L2 final draft spec, it's no longer clear
to me how people want to interpret the appearance of a
species symbol in a math expression.  Should it be a number
in units of substance, or in units of concentration?

Note that this is separate from the question of what the
initial value for a species should be (people want the
option of using either concentration or substance) and also
the question of what the reaction rate expression should be
(people want substance/time, not concentration/time).  I
think those questions are settled at this point.

In the spec as written, we wrote that species identifiers in
math expressions stand for the quantity of that species in
terms of CONCENTRATION units.  However, Joerg Weimar's
recent feedback, and a number of past messages on
sbml-discuss, make it seem that perhaps it should be in
SUBSTANCE units.

Using substance units would appear to be more consistent
with having reaction rates be in terms of substance/time.
One could generate concentrations by dividing species by the
compartments in which they're located.  So if one has two
reactions, A -&gt; B + C and B -&gt; D, with the former having a
rate of "k1*A" and the latter "k2*B" (where "A" and "B"
represent substance amounts), and each species is located in
separate compartments with volumes Va, Vb, Vc, and Vd, then
the rate of change in amount of B would be

   dB/dt = k1*A - k2*B

and the rate of change of concentration in B would be

   d[B]/dt = k1*A/Va - k2*B/Vb

Is that right?  Does that work for more complicated cases?

I'm sorry to bring this up.  I hope this is a simple
question and people can just tell me it's obvious that we're
going one way or the other.

MH
