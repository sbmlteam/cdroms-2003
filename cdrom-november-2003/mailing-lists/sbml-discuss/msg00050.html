<PRE>Hi Pedro and Drew,


&gt; &gt; So, for me at least, I don't see the model and its parameter values as
&gt; &gt; being separable at all.  It may be a long term issue though (i.e.,
&gt; &gt; return to in 2010) and something that will be more relevant to protein
&gt; &gt; interaction-based networks versus metabolic networks et cetera.
&gt; 
&gt; Actually I also agree that parameters and models are not independent. This
&gt; is as true in metabolic networks as it is in protein binding networks. It
&gt; turns out that enzymatic activity depends upon substrate binding to
&gt; enzymes and this is also a spectrum of values (i.e. most dehydrogenases
&gt; can use NADPH and NADH with different affinities, though some are small
&gt; enough that we don´t usually consider the alternate substrate, but even
&gt; this may be relevant at times)
&gt; 
&gt; Although models may be incomplete as some parameter values are not known
&gt; (or uncertain), isolated parameter sets are completely meaningless. This
&gt; is because parameter sets only exist in the context of a model. So even if
&gt; one could have models with several parameter sets, there will never be a
&gt; parameter set that applies to two models. This means, from a computational
&gt; point of view, that making parameter sets independent from models is not
&gt; useful. So, we have arguments from both the biochemical and computational
&gt; sides to refuse this idea of separating parameter values from models.

I don't think so.  For model *parameters*, ok, yes, because they can
have arbitrary semantics valid only in the model.  But for *constants*,
no, at least in some cases.   Given organism and measurement conditions
defined, many constants in rate equations can be shared by different
models.  In this way we can have a efficient means of collaborating with
wet labs.
This is especially true for mesoscopic constants such as affinities and
small ks.  Even if the model include non-orthogonal nature of
protein-ligands and protein-protein interaction networks, I think it
should be constructed ab initio from these fundamental constants, at
least from computational viewpoint.

My idea was that if we decide to provide a separate format for parameter
sets (or constants), it should be able to work as a means of
facilitating publishing and exchanging of measured data for various
organisms and measurement conditions.  

But it is now depend on design decision of SBML itself;  to define the
SBML document including the parameters, or to make it modular by
defining the dynamic model (as opposed to just a model) as a set of a
SBML document plus zero or more parameter set documents.   Being a
high-level description of biological models (as opposed to
simulator-specific low-level ones such as VCML and EML) I still think
the latter is more elegant from software engineering viewpoint.   

But this may need further discussions.  Because it is a design decision,
I like the latter but I'd be happy with the former once decided.


regards,
Kouichi
