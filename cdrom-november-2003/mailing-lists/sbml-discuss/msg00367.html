At the 7th SBML Forum meeting it was agreed that some important aspects
of the Events
feature in SBML were undefined or ambiguous.  In particular the
semantics of events
occurring (firing) at the same time is not defined i.e. there is no
tie-breaking
mechanism specified.  This means that simulators may exhibit different
behaviors
from the same model without us being able to decide which simulator is
correct.

In this context we have the following options for Level 2:

a) do nothing

b) state explicitly that the standard is ambiguous and that results from
	different simulators will differ

	This allows simulators with fixed tie-breaking algorithms to
interpret
	all models.  Model behavior remains ambiguous.

c) allow a model to specify which tie-breaking algorithm to use

	suggested CV for algorithms:

		error

			indicates that if any events are simultaneous
any subsequent
			model behavior is incorrect.  The best practice
is for a simulator
			to stop with an exception at this point.

		deterministic

			indicates that events are fired in the order
given in the event list			

		non-deterministic

			indicates that a random choice to determine the
next simultaneous event to fire.

	suggested default algorithm is "error"

	Under this option we'd put an attribute "eventTieBreaking" on
the "model" element.
	This attribute would take one value from this CV.

d) arbitrarily define one behavior for simultaneous events from the list
in (c)

	This ensures that all models are interpreted in a
straightforward and unambiguous manner.
	Some simulators will not be able to interpret SBML event
structures even when 
	they can support events under different tie-breaking algorithms.
	I don't think 'error' is an option!

My preferred option is (c)

Other areas of events that need to better defined but I hope are not
controversial or
necessarily difficult to implement:

a) Events whose trigger is true at the start of a simulation do not fire
at the start
	i.e. events trigger strictly when the trigger &gt;becomes&lt; true
(transitions from
	false to true)

b) Events can trigger other events - i.e. an event assignment can cause
another event to
	trigger.  

c) when an event X triggers another event Y and event Y has zero delay
then event Y is
added to the existing set of unfired simultaneous events for
tie-breaking. Events like
Y do not have a special priority or ordering within the tie-breaking
algorithm.  
Events X and Y form a cascade of events at the same point in simulation
time.

d) All events in a model are open to being in a cascade.  The position
of an event in
the event list doesn't affect whether it can be in the cascade: Y can be
triggered
whether its before or after X in the list of events.

e) A cascade of events can be infinite.  When this occurs a simulator
should indicate
this has occurred.
	E.g. it is incorrect for the simulator to arbitrarily break the
cascade and
	continue the simulation without at least indicating the infinite
cascade occurred.

f) Given that a variable can change more than once when processing
simultaneous events
at simulation time t then the model behavior for that variable at time t
is the value
of the variable at the end of processing all the simultaneous events at
time t.
