Hi Maria,

Thank you for the note.  In answer to your question, "yes," i.e.,
"yes, I am not sure which discrete I meant" AND, "yes, _both._" It is
all part and parcel of enumerating simulation types and clarifying
terminology.

Would the following modifications to the charter incorporate your
comments fully:
  1. elaborate "discrete" in the example text
  2. Add before "enumerate 5 models," "enumerate simulation types/modes/
     frameworks"
  3. Add as a deliverable, refinment of terminology/concepts.

Where I am coming from: I am trained as a high energy particle
physicist and have worked with, but not written, large simulations,
e.g., simulations with millions of model elements and simulations with
large run times (10's of CPU years 8 years ago.  Since then they have
probably racked up a multiple of 1000 CPU years).  I have written
simple simulators for particle interactions which I suppose you would
call discrete time (but not time on a grid). I have handled random
number management over large run-sets and data management. I have
worked on application frameworks for this kind of processing,
frameworks supporting executables constructed from 100 to 1000
computational modules in a code base of about 4 million lines of C++.
In that context, I've worked on release management, parameter
management and, in general, pulling out great quantities of hair.  A
year ago I started into computational biology at Argonne National Lab
where our interests are in whole-cell modeling with an eye towards
engineering organisms for hydrogen production and carbon sequestration
(greenhouse gasses).

	-Ed

ps. Although this thread is outside the SBW discuss mailing list, I'd
like to see us collect this thread and post it to the list once we've
agreed on the proto-type charter.  Would that be ok?  Then people will
see the history and join in on refining the charter.

&gt; Hi Ed,
&gt; 
&gt; In the first place: thank you for initiating the hybrid models working
&gt; group, and my apologies for not reacting earlier (I had a to get a grant
&gt; proposal out of the way, but that's almost done now).
&gt; 
&gt; I think your proposal is very sensible, and I can't tear it apart at
&gt; all. You're right in assuming that hybrid modelling has not been pursued
&gt; (at least not in detail). What do you mean by "discrete" simulations, by
&gt; the way: discrete time (as in cellular automata) or discrete event (as
&gt; in stochastic sims), or both? 
&gt; 
&gt; Come to think about it: it might be useful (well, it would be for me) to
&gt; have a list of possible simulation types/modes/frameworks, with
&gt; examples. I suspect that this would tie in with the work of the
&gt; alternative representations group that Tom has volunteered to start up.
&gt; 
&gt; Getting hold of examples of biological hybrid systems is the most
&gt; important thing to do first - and I have a feeling that that is not
&gt; going to be as easy as some people think. On the other hand: doesn't
&gt; E-Cell support hybrid modelling, Takeshi? In that case you must have
&gt; examples. At Poul Nielsen's suggestion, I'll have a look at the CellML
&gt; repository - apparently there are several models in there that operate
&gt; on very different time scales (which, of course, doesn't necessarily
&gt; make them hybrid).
&gt; 
&gt; The other thing I would like to know about my fellow group members is
&gt; where they are 'coming from' - so that we can make use of the knowledge
&gt; that is present. For instance, I am a biochemist (turned computer
&gt; scientist in the new millennium) who has measured Kms and other
&gt; enzyme-kineticky things. When I was an experimentalist, I've needed to
&gt; do continuous (ODE) simulations, and 15 years ago we had a problem that
&gt; could only be solved by doing stochastic simulations. The program that
&gt; I've been writing over the last 2 years (NetBuilder) is a discrete time
&gt; base simulator (but it would like to become hybrid...). 
&gt; 
&gt; Well, that's quite long enough for now.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt;

&gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have not done anything on this because there have been no 
&gt; &gt; substantial replies.  How shall we proceed?

&gt; &gt; &gt; This is the promised "first email" related to the Hybrid Models 
&gt; &gt; &gt; working group.  I'd like to propose that we, as a group, 
&gt; &gt; formulate the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; initial note to go to the SBML-discuss group and propose 
&gt; &gt; having that 
&gt; &gt; &gt; done by this Monday?  Then we can carry on in that forum.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; There are three things to accomplish to send that note out:
&gt; &gt; &gt;    o proposed chair, co-chair.
&gt; &gt; &gt;    o proposed charter
&gt; &gt; &gt;    o date at which these proposals transition from proposed to 
&gt; &gt; &gt; adopted.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I would be happy to chair this.  With such a small group, I 
&gt; &gt; think that 
&gt; &gt; &gt; just means occasional call-to-arms and some secretarial work.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Here is a straw-man charter to get us started....tear it apart!

&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; -----------------------------------------------
&gt; &gt; &gt; Charter of the SBML Hybrid Models Working Group
&gt; &gt; &gt; -----------------------------------------------
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Background
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hybrid Models are those that include phenomena modeled in 
&gt; &gt; &gt; fundamentally different ways or which include elements that change 
&gt; &gt; &gt; their mode of operation, or both.  For example, discrete and 
&gt; &gt; &gt; continuous models are fundamentally different.  A model 
&gt; &gt; including both 
&gt; &gt; &gt; would be hybrid as would a system including both non-spatial 
&gt; &gt; &gt; components (represented by ODEs) and spatial components (PDE's, 
&gt; &gt; &gt; reaction-diffusion).
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Mission Statement and Scope
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Except for combined continuous/discrete simulation, little hybrid 
&gt; &gt; &gt; modeling is being pursued in the SBML community [is this correct?]. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thus the Hybrid modeling group is at an earlier stage than 
&gt; &gt; the other 
&gt; &gt; &gt; groups and the mission statement reflects this.  Our 
&gt; &gt; mission statement
&gt; &gt; &gt; is:
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;    1. Enumerate 5 sample problems ("challenges") to be 
&gt; &gt; addressed by hybrid 
&gt; &gt; &gt;       approaches.
&gt; &gt; &gt;    2. Determine what is needed from SBML to express these models.
&gt; &gt; &gt;    3. Determine what, if any, deliverable there is for the Level 3 
&gt; &gt; &gt; deadline.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Deliverables:
&gt; &gt; &gt;    -  proposal for SBML L3 extensions (this is not expected to be
&gt; &gt; &gt;       support of hybrid systems, but only support of 
&gt; &gt; limited capabilities
&gt; &gt; &gt;       like Events done with an eye toward future, fuller 
&gt; &gt; hybrid systems).
&gt; &gt; &gt;    -  challenge problems
&gt; &gt; &gt;    -  SBML requirements for Hybrid systems modeling.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; [This is not meant to be a waterfall process.  I am 
&gt; &gt; actually probing 
&gt; &gt; &gt; here to see if others feel as I do that we are at the very 
&gt; &gt; beginning. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; If so, then some time on seeing if we are all talking about 
&gt; &gt; the same 
&gt; &gt; &gt; things when we say the same words is worthwhile.  The 
&gt; &gt; requirements and 
&gt; &gt; &gt; enumeration of challenges is thus more agreement on a 
&gt; &gt; destination than 
&gt; &gt; &gt; a waterfall methodology.]
&gt; &gt; &gt;
