If the SBML specifies that the dimensions are in
points (that is, 1/72 of an inch), then it seems
to me that simply ignoring the "resolution"
attribute would allow the EML group to treat
the entire diagram as though it were unitless.
RIGHT?

&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; I don';t quite understand the argument in 1). Because the 
&gt; dimensions have no
&gt; units we have no idea how big the 200*50 node actually is, 
&gt; the user might
&gt; have drawn is as 200 meters by 50 meters (unlikely!). The 
&gt; 10pt font size
&gt; however has a physical size. I'm not sure how scaling can 
&gt; help because we
&gt; don't know by how much to scale unless you are implying that 
&gt; the dimensions
&gt; do have some units? The problem is we're mixing dimensionless 
&gt; units with
&gt; units with real units, I can't think at the moment of any way 
&gt; to relate them
&gt; with out making some assumption about the dimensionless units.
&gt; 
&gt; In your example I don't understand the scaling from 200*50 to 
&gt; 100*25 because
&gt; the font is 20pt? It looks like you're dividing by 2 and 
&gt; multiplying by 10
&gt; (in relation to the font size). The 20pt font is 20/72 inches 
&gt; high, however
&gt; we have no idea how high a 200 unit node is?
&gt; I'm missing something here I think, could you explain your 
&gt; approach a bit
&gt; more.

&gt; 
&gt; 1.) Units
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe we miss some point but in our opinion it should not be necessary
&gt; to specify units for diagrams. If all size constraints are specified
&gt; relative to each other the diagram (including fonts) can be scaled to
&gt; any resolution the user/application wants. Lets say we have a node as
&gt; a text label, then we could specify the size of the node as being 200
&gt; * 50 and the font being of size 20. Now, if we want to represent the
&gt; text label with a 10pt font, this would mean that the node would have
&gt; to be rescaled to have the size 100 * 25. If the application doesn't
&gt; want the font to scale with the rest of the diagram, the render
&gt; information for the font could e.g. include an attribute called
&gt; "fixed".
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 2.) SVG as layout format
&gt; 
&gt; When we first discussed creating a layout extension for SBML, we also
&gt; looked at SVG in order to store the pathway diagram/graph (that was
&gt; also a reason why we did not include a 3rd dimension in the first
&gt; draft). Finally, we dropped this alternative mainly because of the
&gt; following reason: SVG is a vector graphics format and not a graph
&gt; format. SVG does not allow to specify relations between objects as
&gt; would be needed e.g. by any (reaction) graph or network.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 3.) Using SVG tags as render information
&gt; 
&gt; Although the complete SVG would probably be an overkill, we agree that
&gt; part of the SVG specification could be used as rendering
&gt; information(elements like e.g. circles, defs,...). One point that
&gt; should be considered is whether the individual SVG elements can easily
&gt; be extended to port 3D information or if we want to limit ourselfs to
&gt; 2D rendering information.
&gt; 
&gt; 4.) MathML rendering
&gt; 
&gt; There was the question whether there are any libraries that deal with
&gt; rendering MathML. So far the only free widget that we found is a GTK
&gt; widget(GtkMathView).
&gt; The alternative would be to convert the MathML to LaTeX, run LaTex and
&gt; convert the resulting DVI file to a bitmap file. For this there are
&gt; free tools, but no libraries.
&gt; For further tools see: <A  HREF="http://www.w3.org/Math/implementations.html">http://www.w3.org/Math/implementations.html</A>
