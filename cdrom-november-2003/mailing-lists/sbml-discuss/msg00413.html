I would agree, but I believe I at least hinted that
I was basing my argument on my experience, not
on "book reading" (reread the part about "we're
tired of dying by ignoring it"). Moreover, anything
I may or may not have read in books has been
replaced by 15 years of software development
experience at this point.
 
But, I believe if you look at it from the perspective
of allowing multiple views, it's very clear how to
approach it from the perspective of separated views.
If, on the other hand, someone thinks it's simpler to
do multiple views from the "embedded in the model"
perspective, I encourage (read: dare) them to give it
a go, and post their solution/approach. What I'm looking
for is, multiple views, each with the potential for multiple
graphical representations of all of the three basic
entities: compartments, reactions and species. Also,
I'd be more than happy to give a model/view version
for them to work off of.
 
My *EXPERIENCE* is that hacking "multiple views"
without model/view separation results in exactly that:
a hack.
 
Show me I'm wrong.
 
John

	I think I agree in this case with John that the MVC approach is probably a
	better alternative having now thought about it a bit more.
	
	However lets not get carried away with what the books say, just because
	something is 'generally accepted' as a design principle doesn't mean it must
	be used *everywhere*. I read an article recently about why SWING is such a
	slow and cumbersome object model (if you've not used any other GUI toolkits
	then you'll probably think SWING is the greatest thing ever) and one of the
	cited reasons was that the MVC model is blindly used everywhere without any
	consideration to other factors, such as ease of use, performance etc. As
	someone once said, theoretically pure but practically useless.
	
	In this case however, it appears that the use of the MVC approach has
	greater benefits over the  increased programming effort.
	
	&gt;But again, this is just a generally accepted design principle
	&gt;that has been around for a very long time for very good reason,
	&gt;and it's so ubiquitous that it has a name (Model-View-Controller)
	&gt;and is almost always referred to as MVC. We tend to live by
	&gt;this rule (because we're tired of dying by ignoring it).
