Thank you very much for your explanation, Kouichi, that helps (me) a
lot! Yes, the talk I remember must have been the one you gave at the
University of Hertfordshire, about a year ago now. I remember it so well
because then I had only just bought Zeigler's book (and I've only
started working my way through it seriously about two weeks ago...).

What I like about Zeigler's book is that he makes a very clear
distinction between models and simulators. Of course, SBML is meant to
be simulator-independent language, and what I am trying to find out
(from Zeigler, or however) is whether such a thing is actually possible.

At the last Forum meeting in Ft Lauderdale, Takeshi mentioned that you
E-cell people have your own markup language to describe models for
E-cell (EML). Is EML capable of describing hybrid models?

Furthermore, what sort of hybrid simulators are already out there
(Copasi is one, isn't it? Would VCell count? And simulators that can
deal with triggered events?)

&gt; 
&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have a book in front of me called "Theory of Modeling and 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Simulation" 2nd ed., by Zeigler, Praehofer &amp; Kim. I remember 
&gt; &gt; &gt; listening to a talk on E-cell (can't remember whether it 
&gt; was given 
&gt; &gt; &gt; by Takeshi), in which this book was cited as the 'basis' 
&gt; for E-cell 
&gt; &gt; &gt; - is that so, Takeshi?
&gt; 
&gt; I think that was me -- I gave a short talk in the SBML 
&gt; meeting at your unversity.  (herts.ac.uk).
&gt; 
&gt; As Takeshi wrote for me, E-Cell Version 3's fundamental 
&gt; algorithm is inspired by
&gt; Zeigler's rigid theory of discrete event simulation.    
&gt; However, the approach is
&gt; very different actually.   It's basically unique, except that 
&gt; I borrowed some fundamental 
&gt; concepts from Zeigler's theory.     Such as:  (1) the fact 
&gt; that it can be mathematically
&gt; proven that any time driven simulation algorithms can be 
&gt; mixed in the framework of discrete event, (2) discrete-event 
&gt; scheduling method, and (3), hi classification of simulation 
&gt; algorithms (see below).
&gt; 
&gt; Actually I'm now writing my phd thesis on this :)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Zeigler proposed two different ways to combine different 
&gt; formalisms:  combining and
&gt; embedding.   The former means that it is possible to 
&gt; 'combine' two different algorithms
&gt; into one more powerful one (such as Zeigler's DEVS&amp;DESS).    
&gt; E-Cell's algorithm
&gt; is different, and may be classified into the latter category, 
&gt; in which each different
&gt; algorithm is embedded in the 'discrete-event world view' as a 
&gt; module.   
&gt; 
&gt; One design goal of my algorithm, which I believe is one good 
&gt; characteristic of my work, is to keep orthogonality between 
&gt; algorithm modules: which means that existing simulation 
&gt; algorithms (such as Gillespie, ODE solvers, automata,
&gt; and anything) can be used with no or a little modification.     
&gt; I think this is very important because we already have many 
&gt; simulation algorithms
&gt; and many partial models of cellular systems on those 
&gt; algorithms.   A big challenge for
&gt; a simulator developer now is how to combine these existing 
&gt; sub-models to construct a higher-order models (such as a 
&gt; whole-cell scale simulation).
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; To get back to your email, Ed, Zeigler et al. distinguish 3 types
&gt; &gt; &gt; (formalisms) of dynamic model specification (as opposed to e.g. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; object modelling, in which there is no concept of time): the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Discrete Time (DTSS), Differential Equation (DESS), and Discrete 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Event (DEVS) System Specifications. DESS includes ODE and PDE 
&gt; &gt; &gt; descriptions. DTSS includes things such as cellular 
&gt; automata (which 
&gt; &gt; &gt; are updated as a whole in a unit 'time' step).
&gt; 
&gt; This is one thing I borrowed from his theory.  
&gt; E-Cell provides three fundamental 'Stepper' classes, 
&gt; DiscreteTimeStepper, DifferentialStepper, and DiscreteEventStepper.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I think (but I'm not entirely sure) that DEVS includes
&gt; &gt; &gt; stochastic models (in which possible state transitions 
&gt; have certain 
&gt; &gt; &gt; probabilities), but also threshold models (in which a state 
&gt; &gt; &gt; transition occurs when a certain parameter crosses a given 
&gt; &gt; &gt; threshold). Have I understood this correctly?
&gt; 
&gt; DEVS include stochastic models, but DTS and DES can also be 
&gt; stochastic.   
&gt; (stochastic automata and stochastic differential equations)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Gillespie's family of algorithms is one good example of 
&gt; discrete-event simulation framework.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; We have tried to use E-Cell to do composite simulation of 
&gt; Gillespie-Gibson and ODE 
&gt; (we used Dormand-Prince 4(5)7M algorithm), and we found that
&gt; it can improve the performance 600+ times in our case.  
&gt; Actually it exceeds both pure-Gillespie and pure-ODE runs.   
&gt; We are also trying some other combinations.  
&gt; For example, we have a long-term depression model of a neuron 
&gt; which has a discrete-time and an ODE sub-models.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; -Kouichi
&gt; 
&gt; P.S.  
&gt; If you are interested, more detailed description of E-Cell's 
&gt; algorithm is available upon request. 
&gt; Sorry, it is still an unpublished work.   
&gt;
