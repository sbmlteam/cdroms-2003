Yes, the bounding box is simply omitted

&gt; If you change their size with the 
&gt; font that get 
&gt; drawn inside, some of the components might end up overlapping and the 
&gt; whole layout that was intended messed up.

The diagram is formed from the totality of the model + layout +
rendering.
If a user changes the model including the name or id text then the
layout and rendering need
to change to compensate.  In fact it really doesn't make any difference
whether the text comes from a label or the name/id field: if the user
changes
the text then yes the diagram might look wrong.  How did you think you
were going to avoid this?

What is essential is not fixing the box but ensuing that when the
diagram
is transmitted (generated and then parsed) both ends know exactly what
font and font size is being used.  If that is arranged then they both
know
what the effective size of the box is.  In fact the bounding box doesn't
buy any thing: unless you guarentee the precise text size you will
either
potentially clip the text when you enforce the bounding box or the box
will be the wrong size if don't enforce the box size.

&gt; If for example you want to add some text 
&gt; to an object that does not only consist of one line, but several, how 
&gt; do you arrange them.

can't you simply apply a transform?
You have this already.

&gt; Or if you want to have some circle that has some 
&gt; text below and above and the text should be centered.

That would be useful, doesn't simple transformation achieve this

&gt; I guess there will unfortunately be no way around making up a whole 
&gt; schema for relative positioning of objects.
&gt; The most simple form of 
&gt; which could be a set of vertical and horizontal boxes that lay out 
&gt; their components in the respective direction. Something like the Java 
&gt; BoxLayout if you are familiar with that. (I guess most any other GUI 
&gt; will have something similar.)

Hmm. sounds like overkill.

&gt; I think implicit text labels are important and we have to think about 
&gt; some way to get them into this proposal. We already talked about this 
&gt; here, but could not come up with a satisfying solution since we ran 
&gt; into some problems. Lets say for example you wanted to have a default 
&gt; rendering for species references that draws the name of the 
&gt; species and 
&gt; below the name, the name of its compartment.

I suggest the following:

a) on 'shape' elements when 'type="sl2:textLabel"'
make 'text' mutually exclusive with another attribute 'field' (say) 
'field' contains the following CV:
'species', 'compartment', 'reaction', 'model'
these indicate the text to be 'filled in' on rendering from
the SBML component that is referencing the glyph.
If present the name attribute on the SBML component
is used in preference to its id.
e.g.:
&lt;shape type="textLabel" id="label1" font="..." fontSize"..."
field="species"/&gt;

b) somehow allow a shape to enclose a text label.  The simplest
approach might be to allow all the attributes of 'textLabel' to appear
on any shape and then include the following new attributes:

textFit with the following CV values : 'clip', 'resize', 'unclipped'
textXMargin 
textYMargin

&gt; &gt; Thanks for your proposal.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Comments:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The separation of layout from rendering provide us
&gt; &gt; with a mechanism for encoding a style sheet
&gt; &gt; approach to rendering given that more than one SBML component, e.g. 
&gt; &gt; species, can refer to the same render group.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I suggest that we consider having default render group 
&gt; identification 
&gt; &gt; mechanism so that its possible to plug-in a render section into a 
&gt; &gt; model without having to specify the render groups on the glyph 
&gt; &gt; structures.  This makes sense to me since most diagrams will have a 
&gt; &gt; consistent look.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; This is a very good idea and I think we can easily 
&gt; incorporate it into 
&gt; the next version.
&gt; Since I already stated several times, the render document is 
&gt; in a very 
&gt; early stage and a lot is still missing. We just posted it to get some 
&gt; feedback, wether the general approach would be considered good.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; for example:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &lt;species id="x"/&gt;
&gt; &gt; ...
&gt; &gt; &lt;speciesGlyph species="x" x="20" y="10" w="50" h="50"&gt;
&gt; &gt; ...
&gt; &gt; &lt;renderGroup defaultType="species"&gt;
&gt; &gt; 	&lt;shape shape="StandCircle"&gt;
&gt; &gt; 		&lt;transformation sx="50.0" sy="50.0"/&gt;
&gt; &gt; 	&lt;shape/&gt;
&gt; &gt; &lt;/renderGroup&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Obviously this mechanism needs to relate to roles etc.
&gt; &gt; In the longer term the render element could be in a 
&gt; different document 
&gt; &gt; from the glyph elements.  To make this work we probably do need 
&gt; &gt; flexible bounding boxes for text/nodes.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Is there provision for a background color for the whole diagram?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; As of now, there is none and I guess the only place, where it 
&gt; could go 
&gt; is with the layout object in the layout part. This will probably have 
&gt; to get a fillstyle attribute.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Is there any reason why the layout and rendering elements 
&gt; have to be 
&gt; &gt; in a separate namespace?  I don't have opinion on this but what are 
&gt; &gt; your reasons?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; First I had thought about putting them into separate 
&gt; namespaces, but I 
&gt; thought that this was changed and they are in the same 
&gt; namespace. I just had a look at the document and they are in 
&gt; the same namespace as 
&gt; the first sentence in the namespace section states. This section will 
&gt; be dropped once the documents are joined. For the time being 
&gt; until the 
&gt; render document has caught up, we would like to hold them 
&gt; separate (the 
&gt; documents not the namespaces).
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I'm concerned that the role attribute is building a fixed 
&gt; controlled 
&gt; &gt; vocabulary (CV) that can't be easily extended modified. In addition 
&gt; &gt; this information has much wider use beyond just layout information 
&gt; &gt; (although I acknowledge that it may be first used for real 
&gt; in layout 
&gt; &gt; processing).  I think we need to think carefully about how 
&gt; we tackle 
&gt; &gt; the use of CVs in SBML considering existing work by groups such as 
&gt; &gt; BioPAX.  IMHO It'll be better if 'role' is integrated into 
&gt; SBML if the 
&gt; &gt; layout structures end up in a separate namespace.  There is a real 
&gt; &gt; danger that we could have overlapping CVs in
&gt; &gt; SBML documents.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I totally agree, but right now, I don't think we can do without the 
&gt; role attribute.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I suggest that you, if there is time, draw the UML 
&gt; diagram(s) for your 
&gt; &gt; proposals, in our experience this make understanding XML standard 
&gt; &gt; proposals easier on the reader.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I don't know much about UML, but I think I can do that as soon as I 
&gt; find the time. Hopefully we will get it into the next version as well.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Forgive my ignorance but what is an affine transformation?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I guess it is rather my bad english than your ignorance. I don't even 
&gt; know if it is the correct english term for what I mean. basically 
&gt; instead of giving translation, rotation and scaling in separate 
&gt; attributes, you specify a transformation matrix which combines those 
&gt; three basic transformation. Actually I think there are some 
&gt; transformation that you can not get by translating, rotating and 
&gt; scaling alone, but most people should be happy with the 
&gt; SimpleTransformation as we call it for now.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I tend to agree with Herbert that how you tackle text and 
&gt; font sizing 
&gt; &gt; is very important to the success of any layout proposal. Again I 
&gt; &gt; haven't picked up the following from your documents perhaps I have 
&gt; &gt; overlooked something or got confused.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What text by default if any is displayed with compartments, 
&gt; reactions 
&gt; &gt; and species or are labels explicit?
&gt; &gt; If labels are explicit where are they specified?
&gt; &gt; By default what font and font size are used to render this text?
&gt; &gt; If there is a default mechanism how are the defaults set?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Those are all good questions and we already came up with some of them 
&gt; ourselves, but the solution does not seem to be so easy. (See below.)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; IMHO the render group mechanism needs to support implicit 
&gt; text labels
&gt; &gt; taken from the SBML component's id or name.  The render group should
&gt; &gt; specify the font and font size for these text labels.
&gt; &gt; The render group should be able to specify that the text is or isn't
&gt; &gt; displayed at all.
&gt; &gt; The glyph should specify whether the bounding box is 
&gt; flexible or not.
&gt; &gt; If we don't do something like this scheme then you have to have a 
&gt; &gt; render
&gt; &gt; group
&gt; &gt; (or something) for each sbml component displayed.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; This is all stuff, we have not had time to really go into yet 
&gt; since it 
&gt; does not seem to be trivial. If for example you want to add some text 
&gt; to an object that does not only consist of one line, but several, how 
&gt; do you arrange them. Or if you want to have some circle that has some 
&gt; text below and above and the text should be centered.
&gt; I guess there will unfortunately be no way around making up a whole 
&gt; schema for relative positioning of objects. The most simple form of 
&gt; which could be a set of vertical and horizontal boxes that lay out 
&gt; their components in the respective direction. Something like the Java 
&gt; BoxLayout if you are familiar with that. (I guess most any other GUI 
&gt; will have something similar.)
&gt; Another issue is the flexibility of bounding boxes specified in the 
&gt; layout part. If we would allow those boxes to be flexible, would this 
&gt; not defy their purpose? If you change their size with the 
&gt; font that get 
&gt; drawn inside, some of the components might end up overlapping and the 
&gt; whole layout that was intended messed up.
&gt; I think implicit text labels are important and we have to think about 
&gt; some way to get them into this proposal. We already talked about this 
&gt; here, but could not come up with a satisfying solution since we ran 
&gt; into some problems. Lets say for example you wanted to have a default 
&gt; rendering for species references that draws the name of the 
&gt; species and 
&gt; below the name, the name of its compartment. How would you specify 
&gt; something like that? One way would be to introduce another vocabulary 
&gt; for some often used model attributes like the names of all the 
&gt; components. But somehow this does not seem to be the optimal 
&gt; solution. 
&gt; Sorry, but as I said, we have not been able to come up with anything 
&gt; good for that problem yet. On the other hand, those are really things 
&gt; we have not been talking about much since it didn't seem relevant for 
&gt; this first draft.
&gt; So any ideas to that are more then welcome.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for the feedback and we hope that we will have some or most of 
&gt; those issues resolved with the next version.
