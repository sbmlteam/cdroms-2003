&gt; Regarding the other issue of substrates (or products) that are also
&gt; modifiers. This is indeed a more delicate problem. From my perspective I
&gt; would label all modifiers as such, even if they are also substrates or
&gt; products. And in Gepasi this is easy to do since the *species roles* are
&gt; separated from the *species* in the rate laws (the more I see these
&gt; discussions the more I like toi have made this choice!) This means that
&gt; rate laws are defined with symbols that are not the species names. Then
&gt; the species are assigned to those symbols that are substrates, products
&gt; and modifiers. This lets me write a rate law such as: V*S/(K+S+M)  and
&gt; then assign the same species to S and M. It is the symbols S and M that
&gt; are labeled as substrate and modifier, not the species that is assigned to
&gt; them (which in this case has both roles). This requires a level of
&gt; abstraction from the part of the user, but that has not scared away a good
&gt; number of users that are not mathematical modeling experts from Gepasi,
&gt; so...

I see, you use different names for the same species to indicate that 
functionally they act differently. I guess that's one way round it, 
but unfortunately we don't all use that approach. I think it is a subtle 
thing to do and I don't think most causal users would appreciate the 
distinction - in Gepasi's case you have a rich enough set of builtins so 
that users don't have to use this trick. If users had to do this for every 
rate law, I think you'd get a few emails asking for guidance.

As for SBML being broken, this is the first time you've brought it up, 
why didn't you say something 3 years ago?

When it comes to validating SBML Level 2 is there any check going to be 
made that the list of modifiers is consitent with the rate law?

Herbert

&gt; 
&gt; I vote for enumerating all modifiers even when they are substrates.
&gt; However given that SBML is already broken regarding this, I can easily
&gt; accept the other option.
&gt; 

What was the other option?


&gt; (it is broken because in SBML the rate laws include names or IDs of
&gt; species directly and thus this distinction becomes meaningless as you may
&gt; understand from the example above).

&gt; 
&gt; PS- I posted only to sbml-discuss given I don¬•t take part in the biospice
&gt; discussions, but feel free to forward this to that list (however I would
&gt; really like to read the answers, unless this becomes a biospice only
&gt; issue)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I agree with Herbert's take on this: things should be unambiguous. Can we
&gt; &gt; come up with some test cases and look at how the proposed specification
&gt; &gt; would handle some potential problem situations involving modifiers doing
&gt; &gt; other things ? Here is another:  on PDE5, cGMP is a substrate and it also
&gt; &gt; binds to an allosteric site on PDE5 to modify the enzymatic rates.

&gt; &gt;&gt; I think we probably need a more sophisticated means of specifying
&gt; &gt;&gt; modifiers. I'm not against some type of modifier list but it's
&gt; &gt;&gt; application
&gt; &gt;&gt; is limited at the moment (very limited!), I'm not sure if anyone uses it
&gt; &gt;&gt; other than a lazy means to parsing the rate law (not an issue in Level 2
&gt; &gt;&gt; I
&gt; &gt;&gt; believe anyway). Could we make it optional if there is a rate law, but
&gt; &gt;&gt; compulsory if there isn't a rate law?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Rate laws are optional - in which case its not possible to determine
&gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; modifiers.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; And for better or worse the community decided even with rate laws the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; list of modifiers were
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; required in Level 2.
