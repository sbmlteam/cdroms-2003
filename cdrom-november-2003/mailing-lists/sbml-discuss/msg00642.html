&gt; Thanks for your proposal.
&gt;
&gt; Comments:
&gt;
&gt; The separation of layout from rendering provide us
&gt; with a mechanism for encoding a style sheet
&gt; approach to rendering given that more than one SBML
&gt; component, e.g. species, can refer to the same render group.
&gt;
&gt; I suggest that we consider having default render group identification
&gt; mechanism so that its possible to plug-in a render section
&gt; into a model without having to specify the render groups
&gt; on the glyph structures.  This makes sense to me since
&gt; most diagrams will have a consistent look.
&gt;

This is a very good idea and I think we can easily incorporate it into 
the next version.
Since I already stated several times, the render document is in a very 
early stage and a lot is still missing. We just posted it to get some 
feedback, wether the general approach would be considered good.


&gt; for example:
&gt;
&gt; &lt;species id="x"/&gt;
&gt; ...
&gt; &lt;speciesGlyph species="x" x="20" y="10" w="50" h="50"&gt;
&gt; ...
&gt; &lt;renderGroup defaultType="species"&gt;
&gt; 	&lt;shape shape="StandCircle"&gt;
&gt; 		&lt;transformation sx="50.0" sy="50.0"/&gt;
&gt; 	&lt;shape/&gt;
&gt; &lt;/renderGroup&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Obviously this mechanism needs to relate to roles etc.
&gt; In the longer term the render element could be in a different
&gt; document from the glyph elements.  To make this work we probably
&gt; do need flexible bounding boxes for text/nodes.
&gt;
&gt; Is there provision for a background color for the whole diagram?
&gt;

As of now, there is none and I guess the only place, where it could go 
is with the layout object in the layout part. This will probably have 
to get a fillstyle attribute.


&gt; Is there any reason why the layout and rendering elements have
&gt; to be in a separate namespace?  I don't have opinion on this
&gt; but what are your reasons?
&gt;

First I had thought about putting them into separate namespaces, but I 
thought that this was changed and they are in the same namespace.
I just had a look at the document and they are in the same namespace as 
the first sentence in the namespace section states. This section will 
be dropped once the documents are joined. For the time being until the 
render document has caught up, we would like to hold them separate (the 
documents not the namespaces).


&gt; I'm concerned that the role attribute is building a fixed
&gt; controlled vocabulary (CV) that can't be easily extended modified.
&gt; In addition this information has much wider use beyond just layout
&gt; information (although I acknowledge that it may be first used for real
&gt; in layout processing).  I think we need to think carefully about
&gt; how we tackle the use of CVs in SBML considering existing work
&gt; by groups such as BioPAX.  IMHO It'll be better if 'role'
&gt; is integrated into SBML if the layout structures end up in a separate
&gt; namespace.  There is a real danger that we could have overlapping CVs 
&gt; in
&gt; SBML documents.
&gt;

I totally agree, but right now, I don't think we can do without the 
role attribute.


&gt; I suggest that you, if there is time, draw the UML diagram(s) for your
&gt; proposals,
&gt; in our experience this make understanding XML standard proposals easier
&gt; on the reader.
&gt;

I don't know much about UML, but I think I can do that as soon as I 
find the time. Hopefully we will get it into the next version as well.



&gt; Forgive my ignorance but what is an affine transformation?
&gt;

I guess it is rather my bad english than your ignorance. I don't even 
know if it is the correct english term for what I mean. basically 
instead of giving translation, rotation and scaling in separate 
attributes, you specify a transformation matrix which combines those 
three basic transformation. Actually I think there are some 
transformation that you can not get by translating, rotating and 
scaling alone, but most people should be happy with the 
SimpleTransformation as we call it for now.

&gt; I tend to agree with Herbert that how you tackle text and font
&gt; sizing is very important to the success of any layout proposal.
&gt; Again I haven't picked up the following from your documents
&gt; perhaps I have overlooked something or got confused.
&gt;
&gt; What text by default if any is displayed with compartments, reactions
&gt; and species
&gt; or are labels explicit?
&gt; If labels are explicit where are they specified?
&gt; By default what font and font size are used to render this text?
&gt; If there is a default mechanism how are the defaults set?
&gt;

Those are all good questions and we already came up with some of them 
ourselves, but the solution does not seem to be so easy. (See below.)


&gt; IMHO the render group mechanism needs to support implicit text labels
&gt; taken from the SBML component's id or name.  The render group should
&gt; specify the font and font size for these text labels.
&gt; The render group should be able to specify that the text is or isn't
&gt; displayed at all.
&gt; The glyph should specify whether the bounding box is flexible or not.
&gt; If we don't do something like this scheme then you have to have a 
&gt; render
&gt; group
&gt; (or something) for each sbml component displayed.
&gt;

This is all stuff, we have not had time to really go into yet since it 
does not seem to be trivial. If for example you want to add some text 
to an object that does not only consist of one line, but several, how 
do you arrange them. Or if you want to have some circle that has some 
text below and above and the text should be centered.
I guess there will unfortunately be no way around making up a whole 
schema for relative positioning of objects. The most simple form of 
which could be a set of vertical and horizontal boxes that lay out 
their components in the respective direction. Something like the Java 
BoxLayout if you are familiar with that. (I guess most any other GUI 
will have something similar.)
Another issue is the flexibility of bounding boxes specified in the 
layout part. If we would allow those boxes to be flexible, would this 
not defy their purpose? If you change their size with the font that get 
drawn inside, some of the components might end up overlapping and the 
whole layout that was intended messed up.
I think implicit text labels are important and we have to think about 
some way to get them into this proposal. We already talked about this 
here, but could not come up with a satisfying solution since we ran 
into some problems. Lets say for example you wanted to have a default 
rendering for species references that draws the name of the species and 
below the name, the name of its compartment. How would you specify 
something like that? One way would be to introduce another vocabulary 
for some often used model attributes like the names of all the 
components. But somehow this does not seem to be the optimal solution. 
Sorry, but as I said, we have not been able to come up with anything 
good for that problem yet. On the other hand, those are really things 
we have not been talking about much since it didn't seem relevant for 
this first draft.
So any ideas to that are more then welcome.

Thanks for the feedback and we hope that we will have some or most of 
those issues resolved with the next version.

Ralph
