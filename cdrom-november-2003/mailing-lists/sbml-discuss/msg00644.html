Hi all,

     Yes, as John indicated, I am more than willing to lead
this group (unless someone else wants to do so more), since
both our models have contraints as a central feature.  These
are flux balance models and 4D chromosome folding models.

      These represent two very different kinds of contraints,
but I expect others can come up with other examples that have
little in common with either of these.

       In the flux balance models, we wish to describe lower
and upper flux limits for each flux reaction.  We have prototyped doing
this using annotations in the flux balance SBML models produced thus far.
A typical reaction looks like this:

         &lt;reaction id="U0140" name="Membrane Transport (Other Compounds): ATP drain flux for constant maintenance requirements" reversible="false"&gt;
             &lt;annotation xmlns:flux="<A  HREF="http://arep.med.harvard.edu/fluxns">http://arep.med.harvard.edu/fluxns</A>"&gt;
                     &lt;flux:limitation lower="7.6"/&gt;
                     &lt;flux:limitation upper="7.6"/&gt;
             &lt;/annotation&gt;
            &lt;listOfReactants&gt;
               &lt;speciesReference species="ATP" stoichiometry="1"/&gt;
            &lt;/listOfReactants&gt;
            &lt;listOfProducts&gt;
               &lt;speciesReference species="ADP" stoichiometry="1"/&gt;
               &lt;speciesReference species="PI" stoichiometry="1"/&gt;
            &lt;/listOfProducts&gt;
         &lt;/reaction&gt;

    Actually, this is the only case of a reaction in the E coli flux model
where the flux is constrained to maintain a constant value.  There are a
number of other cases if irreversible reactions with finite upper limits
and reversible reactions with finite lower and upper limits.  The vast
majority of reversible reactions have lower limits of -INF and upper
limits of INF, and most irreversible reactions have lower limits of 0 and
upper limits of INF.  We have nontheless represented both lower and upper
limits for all reactions lest there be any question of what the default
values might be.  Obviously, from the example shown, either limit could be
a number with decimals, though more often it is an integer or a
representation of Infinity.

     We do not yet have a proposal for the specifics of a 4D chromosome
folding model, but pairwise angstrom unit distance limits are a central
element of it.  If I understand correctly there are no reactions to list
for the models we have now. Rather, we have a chromosome broken into a
number of segments.  Obviously, two segments cannot be occupying the same
space within the cell, though we may not need to represent that in the
model.  We do, however, for all chromosome segments need to set
constraints so that all parts of the chromosome lie within the cell.  So
all segments that are not contrained further can be no further than the
width of the cell from one another.  One example of smaller distance
contraints involves segments that contain genes that code for components
of a common complex enzyme, which are constrained to be close to one
another.  And segments that contain genes that code for membrane bound
proteins must be in the vicinity of the cell membrane.  I do not believe
we would want to be limited to integer values in defining these distance
constraints. 

      Among the differences between these two kinds of contraints are that
the flux limits are arbitrary numbers with no units associated with them
and the maximum distance constraints do have units associated with them. 
There is a pair of limits associated with every reaction.  In the 4D
chromosome model there are no reactions, but there appear to be species,
as long as they are not constrained to being named in reactions.  At least
some pairs of species need to have upper limits of the distances between
them. The species would consist of the chromosome segments plus the cell
membrance if these end up getting enumerated as species.  It would be good
to have a universally applicable upper distance limit for all pairs not
explicitly enumerated, based on the cell width.

         The 4D chromosome folding model also touches on issues relative
to the spatial modeling group, where I sent out the original announcement
indicating I should not lead that group given how atypical our model was
for the main issues in that domain as far as most models are concerned. 
So far no one has stepped forward to lead that discussion, hope someone
will, since there are other models for which it is even more important. 
The 4D chromosome model is not nearly as atypical when it comes to the
requirement of needing to represent constraints.

        It would be good to hear from others who need to represent
contraints that are not identical to the two kinds I have described
already so that we can generate some concrete proposals.  Thanks.

&gt; Many of you may recall that in Ft. Lauderdale I said
&gt; that I or someone in our group (ie. Jim Schaff) would
&gt; start off the Constraints Working Group discussion.
&gt; Many of you probably realize I have not done so yet.
&gt; So, let me first apologize. I should have done this
&gt; many, many moons ago. I simply let it fall off my
&gt; radar, and I apologize for that. This is definitely a
&gt; case of mea culpa.
&gt;  
&gt; Next, let me announce the formation of the Constraints
&gt; Working Group, and then say that I will not be leading
&gt; it. I believe that a number of us are interested enough
&gt; that someone will take it over. In particular, I believe
&gt; that Wayne Rindone would make a perfect leader/
&gt; moderator, and I believe he is interested in doing so
&gt; (note that I'm not committing him to doing so :).
&gt; The first order of business should be to get an idea of
&gt; who is interested, and what we all feel it should include.
&gt; The second order of business should be to put together
&gt; a group charter.
&gt;  
&gt; Unfortunately, once this email is posted, my involvement
&gt; in the Constraints Working Group will end. Indeed, my
&gt; future contributions to the SBML working group are
&gt; definitely in question. My NRSA fellowship runs out
&gt; in about 6 weeks, and my two body problem restricts
&gt; me to looking for a position in the New York metropolitan
&gt; area (ie. where my wife works). I have an interview lined
&gt; up in that area, one that would allow me to continue individual
&gt; reseach including working on the SBML, but I do not know
&gt; what my chances are of getting it. For now I am continuing
&gt; my participation in the DWG, but I do not know what lies
&gt; ahead.
&gt;  
&gt; I hope that Rashad will continue representing the Virtual
&gt; Cell group in the SBML effort, and that Jim Schaff will
&gt; contribute his talents and expertise to the Constraints
&gt; Working Group.
&gt;  
&gt; Best regards,
&gt; John
