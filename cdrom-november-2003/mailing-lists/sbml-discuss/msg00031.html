I don't foresee myself executing a not-entirely-free license agreement 
in order to use a language standard.

W/ respect to the graphical depiction of systems in molecular biology, 
I submit that SBML might want to consider allowing more than one type 
of notation, each optimized for a different purpose (e.g., visual 
time-scale decomposition, clean handling of molecular complexes, 
modularity, "zoomability", physical performance constraints vs. logical 
performance constraints, et cetera).  A good point of departure is 
Appendix E of  "The Art of Electronics" (Horowitz &amp; Hill, p1056 2nd 
ed.).

Best,

****  Appendix 1 ****

Gerry Sussman adds:  "Please tell him about how languages that have 
been really free, such
as Scheme, have survived, while languages that were proprietary, such
as APL, have died."

**** Appendix 2 ****

Roger Brent adds:  "My sense is that these ideas should not be licensed 
at all, that no
royalties should be collected, even for commercial uses, that in
an ideal universe a patent such as the one they  have pending should
not issue, and that we should maybe even challenge before or
after it issues.  The idea of a markup language is not original.
The idea of a diagramatic representation is not original, or, rather,
it was fun talking about it in 1998 1999."

System and method for simulating operation of biochemical systems
Abstract

A system and method for simulating the operation of biochemical 
networks includes a computer having a computer memory used to store a 
set of objects, each object representing a biochemical mechanism in the 
biochemical network to be simulated. Most objects have one or more 
associated signals, representing quantities or concentrations of 
associated proteins, positions of associated molecules, or other 
information concerning the state of a biochemical network. Each object 
has an associated set of methods. These methods include methods for 
determining reaction probabilities for biochemical reactions associated 
with the objects, and reaction simulation methods for simulating 
performance of those biochemical reactions. For a specified simulation 
time period, the operation of the biochemical network is simulated by 
executing at least a subset of the probability determination methods to 
determine reaction probabilities for at a subset of the biochemical 
reactions associated with the objects, selecting ones of the reaction 
simulation methods to execute in accordance with the determined 
reaction probabilities, and executing the selected ones of said 
reaction simulation methods. Execution of the selected reaction 
simulation methods causes associated ones of the signals to be updated. 
Output data representing values of selected ones of the signals is 
accumulated and presented.

&gt; I would like to have the opinion of the members of the mailing list on 
&gt; the
&gt; question of patented, trademarked, or copyrighted work. What level of
&gt; freedom is expected in the licence agreement before such a work may be
&gt; used as a standard, such as SBML? In particular, must the technology be
&gt; licenced royalty free to all users, or is it sufficient to guarantee 
&gt; that
&gt; it is and will be free for academic and non-profit users?
&gt;
&gt; I work for Gene Network Sciences, Inc., and we have a patent pending on
&gt; the Diagrammatic Cell Language for building models. This language
&gt; works well as a description language, and it could be a useful standard
&gt; for the network diagrams that accompany model descriptions, but we must
&gt; know how free it has to be.
