I think I "solved" the "problem" of referencing species references in 
my previous example

see <A  HREF="http://www.sbw-sbml.org/sbml-discuss/archive/msg00366.html">http://www.sbw-sbml.org/sbml-discuss/archive/msg00366.html</A>

In the diagram encoding you have an element 'path' which has a
'reaction' attribute
and a 'species' attribute.  The species reference is indicated through
the
combination of the 'reaction' and 'species' atttributes.

for example

the species reference

...
&lt;reaction id="reaction1"&gt;
    &lt;listOfReactants&gt;
        &lt;speciesReference species="glucoseA"/&gt;
    &lt;/listOfReactants&gt;
...
&lt;/reaction&gt;
...

is referenced by

...
&lt;listOfPaths&gt;
&lt;path type="reactant" reaction="reaction1" species="glucoseA"&gt;
	&lt;line x1="1" y1="1" x2="2" x2="1"/&gt;
&lt;/path&gt;
...
&lt;/listOfPaths&gt;
...

I'm sorry that my formatting got a bit garbled
in my previous message.

This issue of how you reference part of a model from a diagram
will have to be revisited in the light of developments in
the arrays and model composition WGs.  The above shouldn't
necesarily be regarded as definitive.

It might be useful
to know how diagrams will interact with the model composition features.
For example are diagrams always going to show a view of components
all at the same heirarcical level or not?

Putting the type attribute on the path is probably not a good
idea - ideally it should be on the species reference.
It's not diagramatic information.

&gt; Subject: Re: [sbml-discuss] DWG: multiple layouts
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Several people raised the issue of including several layouts for one 
&gt; model. This is a point we actually had not thought about so 
&gt; far, but we 
&gt; agree, that it might be a good idea.
&gt; We potentially see two possibilities to include several 
&gt; layouts in one 
&gt; model:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The first possibility would be a small extension to the draft we 
&gt; mentioned. In &lt;listOfNodes&gt; for &lt;Specie&gt; we would define all 
&gt; nodes that 
&gt; are needed for all the different layouts. Which would 
&gt; effectively leave 
&gt; it unchanged in respect to our current proposal (This implies 
&gt; that only 
&gt; &lt;SpeciesReference&gt;s are to be displayed. If people would like to 
&gt; display Species without a Reaction, each node would have to have a 
&gt; display attribute which represents an enumeration of all the layouts, 
&gt; it takes part in.). For the &lt;layout&gt; tag in Compartment as 
&gt; well as for 
&gt; the &lt;connector&gt; tag in Reaction and the &lt;edge&gt; tag in 
&gt; SpecieReference, 
&gt; we would include a new attribute called "layoutID", which 
&gt; would hold a 
&gt; unique id of the layout for which the element has been 
&gt; defined. E.g. for a &lt;SpecieReference&gt; this could look like this
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;SpecieReference&gt;
&gt; ....
&gt; &lt;edge nodeRef="3" layoutID="1"/&gt;
&gt; &lt;edge nodeRef="5" layoutID="2"/&gt;
&gt; ....
&gt; &lt;/SpecieReference&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; The advantage of this version is that only a small overhead 
&gt; is produced 
&gt; and only small changes to the current draft are needed.
&gt; The disadvantage would be that it would not be very human readable if 
&gt; many layouts would be included in a model.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The second version would be more along the lines of Andrew Finney and 
&gt; John Wagners proposal to take the layout information out of the model 
&gt; and put it all in a seperate tag, lets call it view, after the model 
&gt; definition.
&gt; In this version the different layouts would be seperated in 
&gt; individual 
&gt; tags (e.g. &lt;view id="1"&gt;).
&gt; Each layout element would also have to have some reference to 
&gt; the model 
&gt; element it belongs to. This reference would probably have to be 
&gt; different depending on wether we talk about sbml level 1 or 
&gt; level 2. In 
&gt; level 1, we could just use the name attribute since it is unique 
&gt; throughout the model.
&gt; In sbml level 2, we have the SId on most elements. But what about 
&gt; &lt;SpeciesReferences&gt;, they do not have an SId of their own, so 
&gt; how would 
&gt; they be referenced? So far we have not been able to come up with any 
&gt; reasonable solution for that.
&gt; This second approach would not be much different from the first 
&gt; approach, the layout information would just be moved to a different 
&gt; place in the file. The will probably enhance readability, but on the 
&gt; other hand produce some more overhead since the corresponding 
&gt; elements 
&gt; in the model must be referenced somehow, which is not even 
&gt; trivial for 
&gt; all elements.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; After presenting the possibilities as we see them, we would very much 
&gt; like to get some feedback on what other people think and on how the 
&gt; problem with the missing ids for &lt;SpeciesReference&gt; tags in 
&gt; sbml level 
&gt; 2 could be overcome in order to be able to implement the second 
&gt; approach.

&gt; &gt; Ralph,
&gt; &gt; I think we should start by agreeing on a basic layout ML (call it 
&gt; &gt; Level A, if you like) that is flexible enough that it could 
&gt; be further 
&gt; &gt; modified, but I don't think that should necessarily be our stopping 
&gt; &gt; point; rather, it should then serve as the basis for 
&gt; further defining 
&gt; &gt; additional features that people feel are needed. Thus, I am calling 
&gt; &gt; them "revisions" (see below).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I do not dislike what your group has done, in broad terms. However, 
&gt; &gt; the display markup must be removed from the model's individual 
&gt; &gt; elements, and put in a section all by itself. This is not only a 
&gt; &gt; matter of aesthetics, it's necessary so that your approach can be 
&gt; &gt; modified to include multiple views (something many tools 
&gt; must have). 
&gt; &gt; Andrew did this one way, adding to the &lt;model&gt; element 
&gt; another list, 
&gt; &gt; the &lt;listOfViews&gt; I think he called it. I have taken a different 
&gt; &gt; approach, (go here and click on FutileCycle-0.xml):
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; <A  HREF="http://caboy.uchc.edu/wagner/Science/VirtualCe">http://caboy.uchc.edu/wagner/Science/VirtualCe</A>&gt;
ll/SBML-DWG/Default.htm
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have called this DWG revision 0 in the expectation that 
&gt; this will be 
&gt; &gt; modified over time (as we hash things through) to an actual working 
&gt; &gt; group "revision" (what you called "level"). For now, it's ONLY a 
&gt; &gt; dartboard--something to throws darts at. You will find that 
&gt; &gt; content-wise, it's similar to your approach, but with the 
&gt; diagramming 
&gt; &gt; markup removed from the individual model elements and put into a 
&gt; &gt; completely separate section. You will also see that so far, 
&gt; I've only 
&gt; &gt; put in (x, y) coordinates, whereas your group also tracks width and 
&gt; &gt; height. I am of the opinion that we should do (x, y, w, h), I just 
&gt; &gt; wanted to get agreement from those who don't currently track (w, h) 
&gt; &gt; that they'd be willing to go with an (x, y, w,
&gt; &gt; h)
&gt; &gt; approach and simply convert using x + w/2, y + h/2. If so, then I 
&gt; &gt; would propose to add w and h attributes to compartmentGlyphs and 
&gt; &gt; speciesGlyphs, if not others. Also, should the &lt;diagram&gt; 
&gt; element have 
&gt; &gt; x, y, w and h?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I think once we have massaged this into a working and accepted 
&gt; &gt; baseline level, at that point we can start discussing what more we 
&gt; &gt; want--shapes, fonts, colors, whatever. I'd just like to 
&gt; first get to a 
&gt; &gt; baseline revision that has DWG consensus as "this is the 
&gt; bare minimum 
&gt; &gt; we want/need" before throwing in bells and whistles.
