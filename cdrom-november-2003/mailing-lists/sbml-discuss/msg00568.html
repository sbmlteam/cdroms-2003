IMHO we should be not too worried about the
L2 annotated form of the diagram proposal.
If we can get agreement on the diagram form
over the summer we might be able to get it
into SBML itself before the end of the year
given community agreement either as L2 version 2
or Level 3 version 1.  IMHO we should focus
on developing a minimal graphics proposal
that is obviously and easily extensible.
It is natural that the diagram stuff is
the next thing that should go into the standard
as diagrams are widely supported by existing software.

I'm not convinced (or at least need more convincing)
that its a good idea
to allow diagraming of reactions and structures
that are not formally part of the main model.
Doing this really implies that there are ways
of modelling the same system which perhaps
should be captured in another SBML model.
In addition if this extra information is captured
only in the diagram part of the model it becomes
inaccessable to other tools that could make use
of it.  I have no problem with unstructured
pictures as part of the diagram but I think
we should try to get as much biological information
into the formal model and out of the diagrams.

With respect to the L2 annotation:
IMHO I think having an id field annotation on speciesReference
and not having a refType field on the speciesReferenceGraphic
element is the best approach:

a) it leads us to the approach we're most likley to adopt
in L3

b) it allows us to support A+A-&gt;B reactions

&gt; Hello Andrew,
&gt; 
&gt; On Monday 14 July 2003 12:54, Andrew Finney wrote:
&gt; &gt; I'd like to second John's comments.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; In short:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; a) somethingGR is not a great name for elements
&gt; 
&gt; I agree.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; b) the 'role' attribute is really not graphical information 
&gt; and should 
&gt; &gt; be placed on the species reference.  Ideally the form and 
&gt; content of 
&gt; &gt; this attribute should be developed as part of the controlled 
&gt; &gt; vocabularies work.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; c) the 'refRole' should be replaced by a 'speciesReference' 
&gt; attribute 
&gt; &gt; which contains the identifier of the speciesReference 
&gt; (given by a new 
&gt; &gt; field id field on species reference).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; (b) and (c) can be implemented in 2 ways:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; (i) as an annotation of SBML L2:
&gt; &gt; create an annotation on speciesReference (not specieReferenceGR) in 
&gt; &gt; the SBML model. This annotation has an 'id' field and a 
&gt; 'role' field.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; example:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &lt;speciesReference species="s1"&gt;
&gt; &gt; 	&lt;annotation&gt;
&gt; &gt; 		&lt;graphics:speciesReference id="sr99" role="substrate"/&gt;
&gt; &gt; 	&lt;/annotation&gt;
&gt; &gt; &lt;/speciesReference&gt;
&gt; &gt; ...
&gt; &gt; &lt;graphics:speciesReferenceGraphic speciesReference="sr99"&gt; ...
&gt; &gt; &lt;/graphics:speciesReferenceGraphic&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; (ii)as a proposed form for L3 or L2 version 2:
&gt; &gt; make the whole of your proposal an integrated part of SBML 
&gt; including 
&gt; &gt; new fields 'role' and 'id' on speciesReference.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; example:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &lt;speciesReference species="s1" id="sr99" role="substrate"/&gt; ...
&gt; &gt; &lt;speciesReferenceGraphic speciesReference="sr99"&gt;
&gt; &gt; ...
&gt; &gt; &lt;/speciesReferenceGraphic&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; This are actually two alternatives we also considered. (ii) 
&gt; is of course what 
&gt; we would like to have for level 3. 
&gt; We didn´t chose suggestion (i) because we thought it is not 
&gt; terribly elegant 
&gt; to have an id in an annotation. But that does of course not 
&gt; mean that it can 
&gt; not be the best interim solution for level2. 
&gt; 
&gt; concerning the roles I somehow agree that it is not really graphical 
&gt; information. On the other hand it is not really clear that 
&gt; the information 
&gt; does not belong to the layout (see discussion that will 
&gt; propably follow Johns 
&gt; latest mail).
&gt; 
&gt; Independent from that there is still the problem I mentioned 
&gt; with A-&gt;B 
&gt; catalized by E displayed as A+E-&gt;B+E. I´m sorry I don´t 
&gt; remember who brought 
&gt; up that issue, but it was some weeks ago on the list. 
&gt; In our proposal an arbitrary number of graphical 
&gt; representations can refer to 
&gt; any model object. This is necessary because some (most?) 
&gt; layout programs can 
&gt; display a species as several nodes to avoid long curves and 
&gt; crossing lines. 
&gt; Same could apply to reactions (in a very complex reaction 
&gt; network you might 
&gt; want to display an important reaction several times). The 
&gt; same mechanism 
&gt; works for species reference glyphs and solves the above 
&gt; mentioned problem. 
&gt; The reaction A-&gt;B, enzyme E has 3 species references. If you 
&gt; want to render it 
&gt; like A+E-&gt;B+E the one modifier species reference is refered 
&gt; to by two species 
&gt; reference glyphs. One of these has role="substrate" and the other 
&gt; role="product". I think it makes sense to have this 
&gt; information in the 
&gt; species reference glyphs explicitly instead of only 
&gt; implicitly (in the 
&gt; definition of the curve).
&gt; 
&gt; By the way the reference to the model objects in the glyphs 
&gt; is optional in our 
&gt; proposal. While this might seem strange we think it makes 
&gt; sense. Say you have 
&gt; a very detailed sbml model. Then you want to draw a layout 
&gt; where several of 
&gt; the detailed reactions are displayed as one overall reaction. 
&gt; This reaction 
&gt; glyph would not refer to any single object in the model.  
&gt; Actually this means that the layout part of an sbml can be 
&gt; rendered without 
&gt; looking at the model itself. 
&gt;
