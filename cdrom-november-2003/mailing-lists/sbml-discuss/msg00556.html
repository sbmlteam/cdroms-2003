Then why stop there? Let's define point2D and point3D,
line2D and line3D, rectangle2D and rectangle3D. I know,
why don't we define model0D, model1D, model2D and model3D?
And function1, function2, function3, etc, depending upon
how many arguments a function takes?

Where it makes sense, we should use the schema to
constrain the attribute set. But we're not just
talking about modifying the schema, we're also
talking about modifying the spec, and that is
very worrisome to me.

I would also point out that when given the chance
to do something very similar with respect to
membranes, we chose not to do so, even though it
made a lot of sense to do so--even more sense than
the layout issue. Instead, we chose to use a
single element (compartment) and add a
spatialDimensions attribute. As a consequence,
if/when we add membrane potential, we will not
be able to constrain compartments/membranes
with respect to membrane potential in the
schema. This was a very conscious choice.

Finally, keep in mind that most of the enforcement
of the spec is not really possible to do in the
schema. Does the schema ensure that all reactants,
products and modifiers used in a reaction are
species? Does the schema ensure that we have no
cycles in the compartment hierarchy? Does the
schema enforce the constraint that referenced
user-defined functions must exist in the list of
functions? Did we design units in such a way that
all the yucky details underlying units could be
implemented in the schema? Nope.

I strongly support Kevin's point. The XML schema can, and should
be used to put constraints on the attribute set of elements.

To get back to the subject, having layout2d and layout3d makes it
possible to define attributes (or sub-elements) in layout3d that are
optional in a 3D layout and have nothing to do in layout2D (these
attributes and elements can be absent from layout2D altogether).

In my opinion, this is a better solution that what John suggests,
because if we put attributes x,y, and z in layout to represent
both 2D and 3D layout the z attribute must be defined both
for 2D AND 3D layouts. This is just a simple example, but
consider that other attributes and elements may be needed in
the future in a 3D layout element).

There is an intelligent way to use XML schemas to make the
choice apparent to both humans and software. We can use this
method and benefit from validation schema support. My
experinece is that it will come handy when maintaining the
exchange format, if/when people think it is time to have backward
compatible changes to the spec), or we can just continue relying
on a bunch of assumptions that developers may or may not
remember and implement in their code (especially if they do
not read the spec, as John suggested).

However, if you would be happy with just having "layout" elements
but with a "dimensions=" attribute (similar to what we do with
compartments) I could go with that. This would deal with the
important issues you have raised. Also, in this approach, the
"unexpected" z, d, etc values would not be unexpected, and besides,
don't take a single line of code or a moment's time to ignore.

Actually, that was my first thought. Unfortunately, unless I'm reading the
specs incorrectly, XML Schema doesn't seem to like this. I mean, you could
define the attribute, and even require it, but it would appear impossible to
define different attribute constraints on the descendent elements based
solely on that attribute value. I'm basing this conclusion as much on some
bboard discussions and on this guideline I found
(<A  HREF="http://www.xfront.com/VariableContentContainers.html">http://www.xfront.com/VariableContentContainers.html</A>) as on the spec
itself,
which is pretty tough to read.

And as I thought about it, I decided this is in fact a feature, as it gives
that tiny extra nudge to lazy implementors (not that there's anything wrong
with that) to not ignore it, and I think on balance that's a good thing. And
I'm guessing I can easily make it more trouble to continue arguing with me
about it than it would be to just deal with it... ; )
