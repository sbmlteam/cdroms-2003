I know I expressed dissent in Ft. Lauderdale,
but after realizing that we'd already make
stoichiometric coefficients fractions, I with-
drew my objections to making them floats.

OTOH, making them MathML expressions seems to
be going a bit far--with no payback whatsoever
outside of the issue of having the same constant
in two places being error prone (I'd point out
that having the same MathML expression in two
places is equally, or, arguable, a LOT more,
error prone). Moreover, this "simplification"
means a big complication for developers, who
would now be forced to evaluate these MathML
expressions in their stoichiometry code. As
always, it's a matter of priorities, and we
have much bigger fish to fry (for example, I'd
MUCH rather allow initial conditions to be
MathML expressions--far more useful, with far
more payoff).

&gt; Subject: [sbml-discuss] Changing the way stoichiometries are expressed
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; SBML Levels 1 and 2 so far have stipulated that the
&gt; 'stoichiometry' field on species references in reactions
&gt; must have a positive integer value.  To achieve fractional
&gt; stoichiometries, SBML models are supposed to use the
&gt; additional 'denominator' field (also a positive integer) to
&gt; create a fraction.
&gt; 
&gt; Some users have pointed out that this is not the same thing
&gt; as actually allowing stoichiometries to be floating-point
&gt; numbers.  In certain modeling situations (such as flux
&gt; balance models or other phenomenological models), a user may
&gt; want to record stoichiometries that are not integers.  For
&gt; example, Wayne Rindone's models contain lumped reactions
&gt; with floating-point stoichiometries whose values were
&gt; derived experimentally.  While these numbers could be
&gt; converted into fractions ('stoichiometry'/'denominator') by
&gt; the underlying software, this may not have the same meaning
&gt; in the modeling context as the (originally measured)
&gt; floating-point stoichiometry value.
&gt; 
&gt; A second issue is the question of whether to allow
&gt; stoichiometry values to be expressions rather than only
&gt; numbers.  A simple example of the utility of doing this
&gt; arises in models using non-integer stoichiometries: the
&gt; stoichiometry value may be the same in two of the
&gt; 'speciesReference' structures in a reaction, and it would be
&gt; useful to be able to define a parameter for the value and
&gt; using that parameter instead of repeating the same number
&gt; (because the latter is more error-prone).
&gt; 
&gt; Finally, the logical conclusion of the ideas above would be
&gt; to get rid of the 'denominator' field entirely, and allow
&gt; 'stoichiometry' to be a MathML expression.  Then fractions
&gt; could still be expressed (using the MathML equivalent
&gt; instead of 'stoichiometry'/'denominator'); in addition,
&gt; parameters could be used naturally, and it would leave room
&gt; to grow in the future for more exotic formulations, should
&gt; the need ever arise.
&gt; 
&gt; Several options come out of considering these different
&gt; issues:
&gt; 
&gt; For the 'stoichiometry' field:
&gt; 
&gt; a) don't do anything; keep the 'stoichiometry' attribute as
&gt;    it is currently defined (a positive integer) 
&gt; 
&gt; b) change the 'stoichiometry' attribute to have type
&gt;    'double' 
&gt; 
&gt; c) change the 'stoichiometry' attribute to allow values of
&gt;    type 'double' as well as constant parameter id's 
&gt; 
&gt; d) change the 'stoichiometry' attribute to be a MathML
&gt;    expression 
&gt; 
&gt; For the 'denominator' field:
&gt; 
&gt; i) Keep the 'denominator' as-is (a positive integer)
&gt; 
&gt; ii) Remove 'denominator'
&gt; 
&gt; Please reflect on and discuss these issues on the list.  The
&gt; voting system will be enabled beginning this Friday and we
&gt; will post voting information at that time.
&gt; 
&gt; If you have questions about this topic or the reason for the
&gt; vote, please feel free to call Mike or Andrew directly.
