  hsauro&gt; I'm a little bit suspicious I guess because I'm unfamiliar
  hsauro&gt; with programming to it. Parsing infix is very easy, it's a
  hsauro&gt; first year undergrad problem.

&gt;     Actually, if I remember correctly, it's about a third or fourth
&gt;year undergrad problem.  :)  

In the UK when I was an undergrad it was the first years that did it. In
fact in that year they build an entire compiler, with lexical analyser,
paser and code genertor (no yacc either). That's where I picked it up. Hand
written pasers for infix expressions are pretty easy to build, the lexical
side is of course even simpler. With SBML L1 the library writer does't have
to do any parsing of the rate laws, the simulator will do that since they
already have the capability, Jarnac has two for example, one for the
scripting langauge and one for the model runtime, one reason for the
separation is that the model runtime is much simpler and therefore can be
heavily optimized since it is this runtime that takes takes up most of the
strain during a simulation. Other simulators wil have simuilar capabilities.
With L2 you personally are having to write a parser as well as the simulator
developers. To avoid the simulator people rewriting parts of their code it
would be very convenient to hand them an infix version of the expression,
and I think that's what you're going to do? Eventually maybe the simulators
will take the MathML directly but in the short term that is not feasable,
plus they still have to have an infix parser anyway because that's what
users enter when they want to specify a rate law - even if you have a
predefined list of rate laws, there will always be someone who wants a rate
law that's not in the predefined list. 

  hsuaro&gt; One issue with the conversion to infix is bracketing

&gt;     In an inorder traversal of an AST a sub-expression should be
&gt;bracketed if it has a parent of higher precedence.  This is what
&gt;led to the construction of that particular tree in the first place.

We talked about this before and I know your're on to it.

Anyway, we've got MathML now and I'm happy that you're helping us simulator
developers deal with parsing and writing MathML, personally I don't want to
write this code, it is another layer to deal with, more maintenance, more
potential bugs etc, and I've run out of spare time! A distributed effort to
write code makes life much easier for all of us! I'm grateful for your
efforts here.
