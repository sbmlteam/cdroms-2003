Hi Vijay,


Thank you for your excellent overview of the hybrid systems in computer science.
In computer science 'hybrid' usually means mixing continuous/discrete components.
This is undoubtedly the most important 'hybrid' among many possible 'hybrids' I suggested
in the previous messages.

One serious cultural dissociation between 'computer science' and 'computational sciences'
has been that in computer science simulation usually means running discrete-event or
discrete-time (such as conventional cellular automata) systems or logic programming,
while in computational science it almost always means numerically 
solving differential equations.

My impression is (though I'm not an expert) that CS people tend to prefer induction
to dynamic simulation.   For example, some people are using temporal logic and
collapsed automata to verify propositions on dynamic models.   (Of course some
like simulation, and some computational scientists prefer analytical solutions to
brute force computation. )

As maria gave a good summary, Zeigler's discrete event simulation theory was
extended to include continuous phenomena into the discrete-event world view
in late 90's.   (Actually it was published in 2000.) A virtue of his framework, as
maria pointed out, is that he makes a clear distinction between model and simulator.

Another possible view, however, is to see simulation algorithms as indivisible
parts of the models.    Every simulation model reflects its modeler's understanding
of certain real phenomenon, and it can be thought that some part of the 'understanding'
is implicitly coded in the computational procedure, or the simulation algorithm.
The same model can produce completely different results when driven by different
algorithms, and as we better understand the nature of the phenomenon, we becomes
to be able to create more suitable algorithms, or just to choose more appropriate algorithms
correctly.

I don't think these two views conflict.   These are just parallel understanding of the
same thing.

Recent versions E-Cell deeply reflects the latter view. Also, that is why I distinguished
'hybrid' and 'multi-algorithm' simulation frameworks in my previous message.   
By 'multi-algorithm' I mean to be able to have multiple components (sub-models) that
are sometimes specially designed for specific types of algorithms, and driven by 
these algorithms.   

I believe this is one of the most important abilities of cell biology simulators, and that is
not necessarily required for biochemical simulators.
For example, a model of gene expression in form of S-System or GMA canonical
differential equations, which is often solved by the special ESSYNS algorithm,
cannot be run with Gillespie algorithm.   Or, a fluid dynamics model of 
protoplasmic streaming  (which often involves solid-fluid interaction) described as a set of
navie-stokes equations cannot be simply ported to ODE solvers in an efficient form.
Models include algorithms.

Importance of the 'continuous/discrete hybrid' of course does not decreases
here.  Rather the multi-algorithm framework is-a hybrid (I mean it is a subclass),
and it is indispensable to elegantly design and implement it.

&gt; Folks -- I think this discussion does belong to the main mailing list. I 
&gt; am cc'ing my response to the main list.
&gt; 
&gt; There are of course many notions of Hybrid. The issue of what is the 
&gt; mainline definition and what is not usually gets quite politicized. Let 
&gt; me say that there is a community of folks in Computer Science and 
&gt; Control Theory who have been around for about ten years and who call 
&gt; themselves the "Hybrid Systems" people.  The sixth workshop, for 
&gt; instance, was held this year in Europe.  See e.g. 
&gt; <A  HREF="http://www.stanford.edu/group/hscc2002/">http://www.stanford.edu/group/hscc2002/</A>
&gt; 
&gt; The notion of hybrid here is this. A core divide at the heart of 
&gt; computer science is continuous vs discrete. Traditionally, computer 
&gt; science has been about discrete phenomena --- Turing machines, graphs, 
&gt; lambda calculus, objects, discrete automata what have you. Think of them 
&gt; as discrete, countable data-structures with a notion of discrete change. 
&gt; The new state of the system obtained in "one step" is the same as the 
&gt; previous state with a finite number of "cells" modified. Traditonally 
&gt; logic (as in classical logic, intuitionistic logic, linear logic...) 
&gt; deals with such phenomena as well.
&gt; 
&gt; Whereas classical mathematics, as developed over centuries and applied 
&gt; to engineering and the analysis of physical phenomena is about 
&gt; continuous systems -- functions ove the reals (famously not countable!), 
&gt; with notions of "smooth change", e.g. epsilon-delta. Differential 
&gt; equations of various kinds -- algebraic, partial, ordinary, stochastic 
&gt; are the favored means of modeling.
&gt; 
&gt; Hybrid systems seek to combine this fundamental tension at the heart of 
&gt; computer science and logic. This area seeks to develop algorithms and 
&gt; techniques for representing and reasoning about systems that are best 
&gt; described as combining discrete and continuous change. Consider, for 
&gt; instance, systems that exist in a countable number of "phases", and are 
&gt; subject to continuous evolution in these phases. Transitions between 
&gt; these phases are instantaneous and discrete -- typically they are 
&gt; triggered when some continuous variables cross thresholds. Such systems 
&gt; arise very naturally in practice when you have "controlled" continuous 
&gt; phenomena -- otherwise continuously varying phenomena that is subject to 
&gt; discrete control laws that when triggered can fundamentally change the 
&gt; dynamics of the system (and hence the way this is modeled).
&gt; 
&gt; The relevance of hybrid systems to biology has been pointed out in a 
&gt; number of papers. The first was:
&gt; 
&gt; H Matsuno, A Doi, M Nagasaki and S Miyano "Hybrid petri net 
&gt; representations of gene regulatory networks", Pacfiic Symposium on 
&gt; Biocomputing, 5:333-349, 2000.
&gt; 
&gt; R Alur, C Belta, F Ivancic, V Kumar, M Mintz, G J Pappas, H Rubin and J 
&gt; Schung "Hybrid modeling and simulation of biomolecual networks" In 
&gt; Hyurid Systmes: Computation and Control, HSCC 2001, Rome Italy, pages 
&gt; 19-32, Springer Verlag LNCS 2034, 2001.
&gt; 
&gt; A typical example is gene expression. Expression of a gene A may 
&gt; activate expression of another gene, whereas above a threshold it may 
&gt; suppress the gene.
&gt; 
&gt; A lucid account is given in the attached paper:
&gt; 
&gt; A Bockmayr and A Courtois "Using hybrid concurrent constraint 
&gt; programming to model dynamic biological systems", ICLP 2002.
&gt; 
&gt; This shows how various biological phenomena may be modeling as hybrid 
&gt; systems in HCC, the framework my colleagues and I have been developing 
&gt; for about seven years.
&gt; 
&gt; Best,
&gt; Vijay

&gt; &gt; Thanks again Kouichi for your insight.  It is very useful to define 
&gt; &gt; what it is that we mean by "hybrid" and whether or not that should 
&gt; &gt; effect the definition of a model.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; We have a system which we call "hybrid" as well.  I'm not sure by the 
&gt; &gt; definitions you give whether it falls into the mixed-mode or 
&gt; &gt; multi-algorithm category.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; We assign the reactions in the model to be simulated using either a 
&gt; &gt; continuous method (ode's) or to be handled stochastically by a 
&gt; &gt; gillespie/gibson approach.   These methods run simultaneously and are 
&gt; &gt; synchronized by some scheme.  We also handle what could be called 
&gt; &gt; events and even delay differential equations.  Issues involved here 
&gt; &gt; include synchronization of time steps as well as state variables.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This assignment of reactions to "reaction engines" (that is the 
&gt; &gt; solution method) is done outside of sbml in our simulator's 
&gt; &gt; configuration file.  Thus the model remains portable.  Also this 
&gt; &gt; allows us to run various experiments by changing the set of reactions 
&gt; &gt; assigned to each method.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Attached find a relatively recent version of a paper which we have 
&gt; &gt; submitted and revised for the journal Bioinformatics.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; peace,
&gt; &gt; Tom
