Hello Marc,

I do not see what your point is. If you want to make an argument to make the list of modifiers optional based on your tools I will have to disagree with what you say. As I have pointed out earlier in this thread. The list of modifiers is a separate entity and should be specified by the modeler. It can as others pointed out only partially deducted from the rate law at least the way the rate law is specified by SBML.

The list of modifiers is part of a reaction as substrates and products are. The modeler normally knows which enzyme etc. modifies a reaction. This knowledge should be part of what a tool expects as input.

Even if your tool does not support the notion of modifiers does not mean it is not a necessary part of a reaction model and should be made optional. 

But on the other hand I would still consider your tool as supporting SBML. You are actually in very good company with Gepasi and Jarnac.


&gt; We certainly can't write the modifiers list out as a separate entity, it 
&gt; is derived from the ratelaw. We can make the functionality available 
&gt; quite easily as I'm sure everyone else can from the parser viewpoint. 
&gt;  From the standpoint of our Model Builder tool, this is a very hazy 
&gt; subject (one which I don't think can be supported).
