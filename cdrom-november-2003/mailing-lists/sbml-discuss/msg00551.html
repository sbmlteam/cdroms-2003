&gt; Subject: Re: [sbml-discuss] 2D &amp; 3D layouts

&gt; Ah, but suppose the listOfLayouts contains two layouts, one 
&gt; layout2d and one layout3d. Then a tool which is only capable
&gt; of displaying 2D layouts could know to use the 2D layout
&gt; instead of the 3D one.
Okay. I'm giving you that one. :)
As I said, that was my *initial* reaction.

&gt; And even if one did want to go ahead and try to display the 
&gt; 3D layout in 2D, at least the app could give the user a
&gt; message or warning informing them that it may not appear
&gt; as intended because it was meant to be displayed in 3D.
This would be obvious from the presence/absence of Z values.
But see my last paragraph.

&gt; If we wish to encourage such behavior, then it makes sense to 
&gt; _prompt_ it by having a distinct tag, rather than expecting
&gt; all implementors to take the time and effort to check for
&gt; unexpected z,d/z1,z2 attributes, no matter how trivial that
&gt; might actually be to do.
Well, I don't know about this, either. We have all sorts of
stuff that implementors have to take the time and effort to
check for. We simply ignore them.

Not to be too cheeky, but isn't that what everyone is already
doing anywhere they see a units tag? ;)

Also, ignoring attributes doesn't take any time; dealing with
them is the only thing that requires thought or code. In my
Level 1 reader, I'm ignoring crap all over the place without
even knowing it, much less thinking about it.

&gt; I'm sure everyone is well aware that not all implementors
&gt; take the time to really read the spec, so making the
&gt; divergence very explicit in the XML Schema (which they are 
&gt; somewhat more likely to study) and in example files (which
&gt; they are most likely to study, in my experience) would be
&gt; well advised.
Yeah, well, a lot of us used to try to write book reports in
grade school on books that we hadn't actually read; anyone
care to take a poll to see what kind of grades we used to get? :)

I suspect a lot of us tried to implement without reading the
spec carefully with Level 1, and the results became obvious
in Ft. Lauderdale. Doctor, doctor, it hurts when I do this...

&gt; Finally, being explicit in the Schema makes it easier for 
&gt; Schema-driven tools to do the right thing. The Schema is
&gt; meant to be machine-processable, in addition to readable
&gt; by developers, but Schemas which fail to be completely 
&gt; explicit defeat this.
Agreed. However, I don't want to fall into the trap of
introducing new element names for every little variation,
and it should be clear by now that the layout markup is
going to offer us the chance to *REALLY* abuse this, as
it has ALL sorts of possible variations.

And, the best way to make sure developers do the right thing
is to make the language as simple as possible.

And nowhere is this more true than with layout, not only due
to the potential complexity, but due to the optionality: if
it's optional and complex, developers are going to opt to
ignore it.

However, if you would be happy with just having "layout" elements
but with a "dimensions=" attribute (similar to what we do with
compartments) I could go with that. This would deal with the
important issues you have raised. Also, in this approach, the
"unexpected" z, d, etc values would not be unexpected, and besides,
don't take a single line of code or a moment's time to ignore.
