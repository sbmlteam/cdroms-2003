Someone sent in a patent description for a biochemical network simulator, is
this the VCell one coz' I know that VCell has some sort of patent in this
area. I can't actually imagine how this patent got thought because
biochemical simulation has perused for decades, it's not exactly a new idea.

System and method for simulating operation of biochemical systems
Abstract

A system and method for simulating the operation of biochemical 
networks includes a computer having a computer memory used to store a 
set of objects, each object representing a biochemical mechanism in the 
biochemical network to be simulated. Most objects have one or more 
associated signals, representing quantities or concentrations of 
associated proteins, positions of associated molecules, or other 
information concerning the state of a biochemical network. Each object 
has an associated set of methods. These methods include methods for 
determining reaction probabilities for biochemical reactions associated 
with the objects, and reaction simulation methods for simulating 
performance of those biochemical reactions. For a specified simulation 
time period, the operation of the biochemical network is simulated by 
executing at least a subset of the probability determination methods to 
determine reaction probabilities for at a subset of the biochemical 
reactions associated with the objects, selecting ones of the reaction 
simulation methods to execute in accordance with the determined 
reaction probabilities, and executing the selected ones of said 
reaction simulation methods. Execution of the selected reaction 
simulation methods causes associated ones of the signals to be updated. 
Output data representing values of selected ones of the signals is 
accumulated and presented.

&gt; I would like to have the opinion of the members of the mailing list on 
&gt; the
&gt; question of patented, trademarked, or copyrighted work. What level of
&gt; freedom is expected in the licence agreement before such a work may be
&gt; used as a standard, such as SBML? In particular, must the technology be
&gt; licenced royalty free to all users, or is it sufficient to guarantee 
&gt; that
&gt; it is and will be free for academic and non-profit users?
&gt;
&gt; I work for Gene Network Sciences, Inc., and we have a patent pending on
&gt; the Diagrammatic Cell Language for building models. This language
&gt; works well as a description language, and it could be a useful standard
&gt; for the network diagrams that accompany model descriptions, but we must
&gt; know how free it has to be.
