Ralph, the main reason why I was going to look at Jonathon's proposal 
first was because he has some dimensioning information which means I know 
what size to draw the diagram. As far as I can tell your proposal does not 
have this information, are there even any default dimensions? As a result I am 
unable use your proposal as it stands. If I have a mistaken view here do 
please correct me, and if you have suggestions on sizing the layout 
expressed in EML, I'd be happy to listen. I think Jonathon has yet to 
specify the font sizing, at the momemt the proposal suggests using the 
unitsin the diagram, not sure if this is a good idea as traditionally font 
info is expressed in pts. Currenlty even Jonathon's proposal will not be 
easy to use. So there appear to be issues with both. In 
Jdesigner I use pts to indicate font sizes and dimensions are set by 
default to by 92dpi. I have a version 2 (unpublished) which adds further 
material but this was done before the DWG got going.

&gt; Sorry for the delay, but with everybody on vacation, this has been
&gt; lying around for some time.
&gt; In case anybody is wondering. This is the next version of a proposal
&gt; for a layout extension to SBML2.
&gt; 
&gt; This version includes some important new features like the possibility
&gt; to group several layout objects and the possibility to specify edges to
&gt; denote relations.
&gt; We also incorporated the suggestions we got from the discussion. E.g.
&gt; the syntax is now more SBML like as references attributes are called
&gt; after the thing that is being referenced. So the reference attribute to
&gt; the SBML compartment id in the compartmentGlyph is now called
&gt; compartment. We also got rid of all the ...GR(s), they are now called
&gt; ...Glyph(s).
&gt; There are some smaller changes (See "List of Changes" in the document).
&gt; 
&gt; We tried to come up with layout problems that can not be solved with
&gt; this proposal and so far we have not been able to come up with any. So
&gt; if you know of some layout that can not be specified in terms of this
&gt; proposal, please let us know.
&gt; 
&gt; There has been a new proposal for a layout extension by Jonathan Webb a
&gt; few days ago. We would have preferred for Jonathan to give us some
&gt; feedback as to what he didn't like about the proposal that was already
&gt; there and so help to speed things up, because this is what a discussion
&gt; list is for and this is the reason why we made the proposal to the
&gt; discussion list in the first place.
&gt; Looking at his proposal we think that it is missing some things
&gt; that our proposal already has and that we think are important.
&gt; 
&gt; 1) Jonathan himself stated in his document that it was not a full 3D
&gt; specification, but rather 2.5D. But with the inclusion of geometry
&gt; information on compartments in upcoming versions of SBML, we think that
&gt; the proposal should include the possibility to render objects in 3D.
&gt; 
&gt; 2) Jonathan's proposal takes color specifications from HTML and limits
&gt; colors to RGB instead of RGBA. Partly transparent objects might really
&gt; be useful when working with 2.5D or 3D layouts, so colors should really
&gt; have an alpha channel.
&gt; 
&gt; 3) As has been noted in earlier discussions on this list, there was an
&gt; agreement that metaids should not be used to reference objects. Jonathan
&gt; does this in his edge.
&gt; 
&gt; 4) In the edge object of his proposal, Jonathan references the species
&gt; reference of the model for the edge, but since a species can be
&gt; represented by several graphical objects in a layout, there is no easy 
&gt; way to
&gt; find out which of possibly several species glyphs should
&gt; be connected to a given reaction. He tries to circumvent this problem
&gt; by identifying the species glyphs by coordinates which will fail if to
&gt; species glyphs share the same coordinates.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;    We are aware of the fact that so far our proposal only includes layout
&gt; information since we wanted to separate the layout information from the
&gt; render information. So in order to get an agreement on the layout part,
&gt; we did not do much work on the render part yet. As we took from the
&gt; discussion, there was some agreement as to that it was a good idea to
&gt; separate render and layout information. As stated above, we tried to
&gt; find layout examples that could not be implemented with this proposal
&gt; and so far we found none. If someone finds such an example we would be
&gt; glad to hear of it so we could make the necessary changes. We also
&gt; would very much like more feedback on what else people are missing from
&gt; the proposal since this is the only way we can reach an agreement.
&gt; Mails that only state that something is missing without ever
&gt; elaborating on this are therefore not very helpful and won't help in
&gt; reaching an agreement.
&gt; We feel that this proposal has come a long way and we thank all the
&gt; people that participated in the discussion. We don't know, if this new
&gt; proposal has everything that people expect of it, but as far as we are
&gt; concerned, we would be ready to move on to getting the specification
&gt; for the render information written down. Now if the majority of people
&gt; on this list feel that they would rather go with Jonathan's proposal
&gt; and work from there, we would appreciate it if you let us know as soon
&gt; as possible.

&gt; Ralph
