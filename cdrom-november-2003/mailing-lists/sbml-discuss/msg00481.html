Hi Maria and members,

I'm sorry, my late response, I got my pc's hdd replacement and missed mails.

Yes, at the meeting, I didn't talk about the relation between Zeigler's
theory and the E-Cell simulation core, Kouichi who is E-Cell system's
architect is now studying this issue.
Basically, it is true that E-Cell core was loosely inspired from Zeigler's,
but now the latest version has different system to integrate various (and
independent) algorithms into the simulation model. But actually, I haven't
made own hybrid model on E-Cell yet, thus I'm not sure about this issue in
detail. Could you join to our discussion &gt; Kouichi

Anyway, for the concerning about this issue, I agree with Ed's proto-type
charter with some changes. We need some case study about hybrid model and
should define the hybrid model which is described by SBML L3.

&gt; Hi Ed + others,
&gt;
&gt; I have a book in front of me called "Theory of Modeling and Simulation"
&gt; 2nd ed., by Zeigler, Praehofer &amp; Kim. I remember listening to a talk on
&gt; E-cell (can't remember whether it was given by Takeshi), in which this
&gt; book was cited as the 'basis' for E-cell - is that so, Takeshi? It seems
&gt; to me that the theory presented in this book is just what we need for
&gt; our purposes, but since I'm by no means an expert in this area, there
&gt; may be competing theories. Does Vijay have an opinion on this? For the
&gt; time being I'll assume that Zeigler et al. have done a good analysis of
&gt; the process of modelling &amp; simulation, and use what I've learned from
&gt; the book so far.
&gt;
&gt; To get back to your email, Ed, Zeigler et al. distinguish 3 types
&gt; (formalisms) of dynamic model specification (as opposed to e.g. object
&gt; modelling, in which there is no concept of time): the Discrete Time
&gt; (DTSS), Differential Equation (DESS), and Discrete Event (DEVS) System
&gt; Specifications. DESS includes ODE and PDE descriptions. DTSS includes
&gt; things such as cellular automata (which are updated as a whole in a unit
&gt; 'time' step). I think (but I'm not entirely sure) that DEVS includes
&gt; stochastic models (in which possible state transitions have certain
&gt; probabilities), but also threshold models (in which a state transition
&gt; occurs when a certain parameter crosses a given threshold). Have I
&gt; understood this correctly?
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Would the following modifications to the charter incorporate
&gt; &gt; your comments fully:
&gt; &gt;   1. elaborate "discrete" in the example text
&gt;
&gt; I don't think you need to elaborate discrete (in the introduction) any
&gt; further, as you're using it in a very general way, but maybe you could
&gt; leave out the "Except for combined continuous/discrete simulation" bit,
&gt; because even that sounds too grand in the light of what people are
&gt; currently doing (to my knowledge).
&gt;
&gt; &gt;   2. Add before "enumerate 5 models," "enumerate simulation
&gt; &gt; types/modes/frameworks"
&gt;
&gt; Yes, I think that would be a good idea (btw, when you say 'enumerate',
&gt; do you mean 'list', or does enumerate have any further significance
&gt; (like: we need to give each one a number)?). Maybe "list modelling
&gt; formalisms" expresses more precisely what we're going to talk about than
&gt; "simulation types/modes/frameworks"?
&gt;
&gt; &gt;   3. Add as a deliverable, refinment of terminology/concepts.
&gt;
&gt; Agreed. Very necessary.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; ps. Although this thread is outside the SBW discuss mailing
&gt; &gt; list, I'd like to see us collect this thread and post it to
&gt; &gt; the list once we've agreed on the proto-type charter.  Would
&gt; &gt; that be ok?  Then people will see the history and join in on
&gt; &gt; refining the charter.
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; Yes, that's a good idea - we keep it between ourselves until we agree
&gt; what it is we're talking about, but after that give people the
&gt; opportunity to check our arguments. By that time we need to ask everyone
&gt; on the list whether they can give us examples. I can think of several
&gt; systems that would 'benefit from' hybrid modelling, but working out
&gt; those things are whole projects in themselves, and it would be necessary
&gt; to apply for funding to carry them out. (Btw: I'm open to that: my
&gt; contract runs out by the end of the year).
&gt;
&gt; Well, enough again,
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Hi Maria,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thank you for the note.  In answer to your question, "yes,"
&gt; &gt; i.e., "yes, I am not sure which discrete I meant" AND, "yes,
&gt; &gt; _both._" It is all part and parcel of enumerating simulation
&gt; &gt; types and clarifying terminology.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Would the following modifications to the charter incorporate
&gt; &gt; your comments fully:
&gt; &gt;   1. elaborate "discrete" in the example text

&gt; &gt; types/modes/
&gt; &gt;      frameworks"
&gt; &gt;   3. Add as a deliverable, refinment of terminology/concepts.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Where I am coming from: I am trained as a high energy
&gt; &gt; particle physicist and have worked with, but not written,
&gt; &gt; large simulations, e.g., simulations with millions of model
&gt; &gt; elements and simulations with large run times (10's of CPU
&gt; &gt; years 8 years ago.  Since then they have probably racked up a
&gt; &gt; multiple of 1000 CPU years).  I have written simple
&gt; &gt; simulators for particle interactions which I suppose you
&gt; &gt; would call discrete time (but not time on a grid). I have
&gt; &gt; handled random number management over large run-sets and data
&gt; &gt; management. I have worked on application frameworks for this
&gt; &gt; kind of processing, frameworks supporting executables
&gt; &gt; constructed from 100 to 1000 computational modules in a code
&gt; &gt; base of about 4 million lines of C++. In that context, I've
&gt; &gt; worked on release management, parameter management and, in
&gt; &gt; general, pulling out great quantities of hair.  A year ago I
&gt; &gt; started into computational biology at Argonne National Lab
&gt; &gt; where our interests are in whole-cell modeling with an eye
&gt; &gt; towards engineering organisms for hydrogen production and
&gt; &gt; carbon sequestration (greenhouse gasses).

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Ed,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; In the first place: thank you for initiating the hybrid
&gt; &gt; models working
&gt; &gt; &gt; group, and my apologies for not reacting earlier (I had a to get a
&gt; &gt; &gt; grant proposal out of the way, but that's almost done now).
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I think your proposal is very sensible, and I can't tear it
&gt; &gt; apart at
&gt; &gt; &gt; all. You're right in assuming that hybrid modelling has not been
&gt; &gt; &gt; pursued (at least not in detail). What do you mean by "discrete"
&gt; &gt; &gt; simulations, by the way: discrete time (as in cellular automata) or
&gt; &gt; &gt; discrete event (as in stochastic sims), or both?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Come to think about it: it might be useful (well, it would
&gt; &gt; be for me)
&gt; &gt; &gt; to have a list of possible simulation types/modes/frameworks, with
&gt; &gt; &gt; examples. I suspect that this would tie in with the work of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; alternative representations group that Tom has volunteered to start
&gt; &gt; &gt; up.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Getting hold of examples of biological hybrid systems is the most
&gt; &gt; &gt; important thing to do first - and I have a feeling that that is not
&gt; &gt; &gt; going to be as easy as some people think. On the other
&gt; &gt; hand: doesn't
&gt; &gt; &gt; E-Cell support hybrid modelling, Takeshi? In that case you
&gt; &gt; must have
&gt; &gt; &gt; examples. At Poul Nielsen's suggestion, I'll have a look at
&gt; &gt; the CellML
&gt; &gt; &gt; repository - apparently there are several models in there
&gt; &gt; that operate
&gt; &gt; &gt; on very different time scales (which, of course, doesn't
&gt; &gt; necessarily
&gt; &gt; &gt; make them hybrid).
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; The other thing I would like to know about my fellow group
&gt; &gt; members is
&gt; &gt; &gt; where they are 'coming from' - so that we can make use of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; knowledge that is present. For instance, I am a biochemist (turned
&gt; &gt; &gt; computer scientist in the new millennium) who has measured Kms and
&gt; &gt; &gt; other enzyme-kineticky things. When I was an experimentalist, I've
&gt; &gt; &gt; needed to do continuous (ODE) simulations, and 15 years ago
&gt; &gt; we had a
&gt; &gt; &gt; problem that could only be solved by doing stochastic
&gt; &gt; simulations. The
&gt; &gt; &gt; program that I've been writing over the last 2 years
&gt; &gt; (NetBuilder) is a
&gt; &gt; &gt; discrete time base simulator (but it would like to become
&gt; &gt; hybrid...).
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, that's quite long enough for now.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Cheers,

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Charter of the SBML Hybrid Models Working Group
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -----------------------------------------------
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Background
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hybrid Models are those that include phenomena modeled in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fundamentally different ways or which include elements
&gt; &gt; that change
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their mode of operation, or both.  For example, discrete and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; continuous models are fundamentally different.  A model
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; including both
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would be hybrid as would a system including both non-spatial
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; components (represented by ODEs) and spatial components (PDE's,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reaction-diffusion).
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mission Statement and Scope
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Except for combined continuous/discrete simulation,
&gt; &gt; little hybrid
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; modeling is being pursued in the SBML community [is
&gt; &gt; this correct?].
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus the Hybrid modeling group is at an earlier stage than
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the other
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; groups and the mission statement reflects this.  Our
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mission statement
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    1. Enumerate 5 sample problems ("challenges") to be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; addressed by hybrid
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;       approaches.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    2. Determine what is needed from SBML to express
&gt; &gt; these models.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    3. Determine what, if any, deliverable there is for
&gt; &gt; the Level 3
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deadline.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Deliverables:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    -  proposal for SBML L3 extensions (this is not
&gt; &gt; expected to be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;       support of hybrid systems, but only support of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; limited capabilities
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;       like Events done with an eye toward future, fuller
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hybrid systems).
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    -  challenge problems
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    -  SBML requirements for Hybrid systems modeling.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; [This is not meant to be a waterfall process.  I am
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actually probing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; here to see if others feel as I do that we are at the very
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; beginning.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If so, then some time on seeing if we are all talking about
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the same
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; things when we say the same words is worthwhile.  The
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; requirements and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enumeration of challenges is thus more agreement on a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; destination than
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a waterfall methodology.]
