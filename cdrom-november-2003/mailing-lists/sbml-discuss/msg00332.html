Oh I fully agree. I would love to have some C library that renders some 
MathML statement to a bitmap representation, but I haven't found one so 
far. Actually I think I would already be happy with some tool that 
converts MathML to SVG, because I think there are libraries that render 
SVG to bitmap, but besides some commercial product, I haven't found one 
either.
Actually this GtkMathView widget I emntioned can be used to just render 
MathML to bitmap without actually having to use the GTK widget as your 
GUI toolkit, but you still need GTK installed because it is linked 
against it.
JEuklid isn't an option because you need the whole tomcat and Cocoon in 
order to use it.
The mozilla people are also able to render MathML, but to find the part 
that does it in all this code is certainly beyond me.
I guess there are a lot of people who would like to be able to display 
some MathML as a nice looking graphic, so if anybody knows of some 
solution that is free, please step forward.
As I said, right now, I convert all formulas to latex, run latex and 
convert the dvi file to png. It sure works and it looks a lot nicer 
especially for large formulas, but I am far from happy with it.
The only thing I said was, that I do not agree with Herbert Sauro on 
the point that a java tool the renders MathML to some bitmap would be 
useless to programmers of other languages. I think that with newer gcc 
compiler you can make java classes into standard shared libraries for 
which you then can write wrapper for other languages.

&gt; I guess the way I was thinking about the whole math display is...
&gt;
&gt; Either a program wants to display math in a nice and formatted
&gt; manner, or it doesn't. Those that don't want to display formatted
&gt; math simply won't display formatted math. But, those that *do*
&gt; want to display formatted math are faced with doing the drawing
&gt; and layout themselves. For *those* applications, it would be very
&gt; helpful to have the MathML, because it basically specifies the
&gt; layout for you.
&gt;
&gt; For example, in the Virtual Cell, when you type in an expression
&gt; like (a+b)/(c+d/e), Jim Schaff has written a very nice algorithm
&gt; that takes the expression tree as input and outputs a "format tree"
&gt; very similar to the MathML display.
&gt;
&gt; So I was thinking it might make it easier for those people wanting
&gt; to do something like that.

&gt;
&gt; 	I fully agree that both options are far from optimal, especially the
&gt; 	second one since you need all those programs installed. On the other
&gt; 	hand, it seems to work as long as there is no other option.
&gt; 	Actually a java lib would not be that bad I think. Since the new gcc
&gt; 	compiler can compile java code to machine byte code, it should be
&gt; 	possible to create a normal library from java code and then write some
&gt; 	wrappers for perl, python, etc.
&gt; 	Maybe I am wrong. Has anybody else played around with the gcc java
&gt; 	compiler yet?

&gt; 	&gt; All very well on paper but how do we programmers implement it? 
&gt; Someone
&gt; 	&gt; earlier mentioned that they only knew of two portable libs (maybe) 
&gt; that
&gt; 	&gt; could render MathML, a GTK method and a long winded approach to 
&gt; convery
&gt; 	&gt; MathML to Latex, etc etc. Neither method sounds appleaing.
&gt; 	&gt;
&gt; 	&gt; I'm sure there is a Java lib somewhere but that isn't of much use to
&gt; 	&gt; many of
&gt; 	&gt; use who use other languages.

&gt; 	&gt;&gt; There was also some discussion in Florida about display
&gt; 	&gt;&gt; MathML, and I got to thinking about it...it seems like we
&gt; 	&gt;&gt; could include display MathML markup in the Diagrams
&gt; 	&gt;&gt; portion. Imagine if, in addition to diagrams for the
&gt; 	&gt;&gt; reaction pathways, we also had a list of MathML display
&gt; 	&gt;&gt; elements that are linked to the various MathML expressions
&gt; 	&gt;&gt; in the SBML document.
&gt; 	&gt;&gt;
&gt; 	&gt;&gt; I was thinking of an addition to something like JDesigner
&gt; 	&gt;&gt; such that when you hovered the pointer over a reaction
&gt; 	&gt;&gt; arrow, you got a "tooltips" like action that popped up a
&gt; 	&gt;&gt; tooltip window, and in it was displayed that reaction's
&gt; 	&gt;&gt; kinetics; this MathML display element could provide the
&gt; 	&gt;&gt; layout for the content (just as an example).
&gt; 	&gt;&gt;
&gt; 	&gt;&gt; However, someone--maybe me?--poninted out that we
&gt; 	&gt;&gt; all pretty much knew how to do the math display anyway,
&gt; 	&gt;&gt; so it wasn't clear to me if there was any consensus that
&gt; 	&gt;&gt; display MathML was needed. Anyone care to weigh in
&gt; 	&gt;&gt; on this? Poul, any comments?
&gt; 	&gt; MathML provides mechanisms to combine content and presentation 
&gt; markup.
&gt; 	&gt; Chapter 5 of the MathML 2.0 specification is devoted to just this
&gt; 	&gt; issue. It seems pretty straightforward to tie the two together to
&gt; 	&gt; enable the behaviour that you describe above.
