Sven,
This is very similar to what I have posted.
Thumbs up.

Sorry I've been offline for a week, we had our
annual short course, and my connection from
home was down (thanks, Comcast). I'm now catching
up on the huge volume of unread email.

John

&gt; Subject: [sbml-discuss] DWG: Suggestion for layout extension
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Hello all,
&gt; 
&gt; we would like to present another suggestion for the sbml 
&gt; layout extension.
&gt; 
&gt; For that we took the basic idea that information about the 
&gt; position and 
&gt; relations between the graphical objects should be separated 
&gt; from render 
&gt; information like  line thicknesses, colors, shapes. We only 
&gt; deal here with 
&gt; the first. 
&gt; We took from the discussion in this forum what we think are 
&gt; the important 
&gt; requirements (that our first suggestion did not meet).
&gt; 
&gt; The requirements we considered are:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. several layouts for one model in one file.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. layout separate from the model in the file.
&gt; 
&gt; 3. one model object (compartment, species, reaction, species 
&gt; reference) can be 
&gt; represented by several graphical objects.
&gt; 
&gt; 4. graphical objects that do not refer to model objects are 
&gt; possible (Of 
&gt; course graphical objects can refer to a part of the model and 
&gt; usually do).
&gt; 
&gt; We provide a sample sbml file and a png file with the 
&gt; rendered layout. These 
&gt; files were generated manually and the sbml code is based on a 
&gt; hypothetical 
&gt; sbml level 2 that would have id´s for species references.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Some additional notes:
&gt; 
&gt; -the basic structure of this suggestion is similar to John 
&gt; Wagner´s draft 
&gt; (that reflects requirements 1 and 2), while our first try was 
&gt; similar to 
&gt; Herbert Sauro´s suggestion.
&gt; 
&gt; - the ...GR in the tag names stands for graphical 
&gt; representation (but the 
&gt; actual names of the tags don´ t really matter that muchin 
&gt; this phase of the 
&gt; discussion)
&gt; 
&gt; -all the graphical objects have an id. This id is used only 
&gt; in the case of the 
&gt; speciesGR (it is needed in the reactionGR). But we think that 
&gt; every object in 
&gt; sbml should have an id.
&gt; 
&gt; - the "ref" attribute in the graphical objects is optional 
&gt; and refers to the 
&gt; id of a model object.
&gt; 
&gt; - there are two kinds of graphical objects that don´t refer 
&gt; to a model object: 
&gt; first the ones that _could_ refer to a model object but don´t 
&gt; (since the 
&gt; "ref" attribute is optional). This means you can have species 
&gt; and reaction, 
&gt; ... in the layout that are not in the model; second the 
&gt; objects that are in 
&gt; the "listOfAdditionalGraphicalObjects". In our example we 
&gt; have put only a 
&gt; text label object in this list, other types of objects would 
&gt; be possible.
&gt; 
&gt; -  since a species reference in the model connects the 
&gt; reaction with the 
&gt; species, and the arrows (or arcs) in the diagram  connect the 
&gt; reactionGR with 
&gt; the speciesGR, we think the arcs (or arrows) should refer to 
&gt; the species 
&gt; references. To reflect that we have called them speciesReferenceGR
&gt; 
&gt; - the possibility to have several speciesReferenceGR objects 
&gt; that refer to one 
&gt; species reference in the model solves the following problem that was 
&gt; mentioned in the discussion on the list: The user might want 
&gt; to render the 
&gt; reaction A-&gt;B with encyme E as a reaction A+E-&gt;B+E. So we 
&gt; have 3 species 
&gt; references in the model (one substrate, product, modifier 
&gt; each) but 4 arcs 
&gt; (two substrate, two product). So two speciesReferenceGRs (one 
&gt; substrate, one 
&gt; product) refer to one species reference (modifier) in the 
&gt; model. This is the 
&gt; reason why we put the "role" attribute in the 
&gt; speciesReferenceGR tag. It 
&gt; should be optional. If it is not there the role is taken from 
&gt; the species 
&gt; reference. 
&gt; 
&gt; -Right now the speciesReferenceGR specifies only startpoint 
&gt; and endpoint of 
&gt; the arc. It might make sense to include coordinates for an 
&gt; arbitrary number 
&gt; of points in the speciesReferenceGRs to describe the  the arc. 
&gt; 
&gt; We hope that our suggestion can be the base of some 
&gt; discussion. Did we miss 
&gt; anything important? Please comment.
