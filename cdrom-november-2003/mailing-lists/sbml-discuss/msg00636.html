&gt; The layout information is simply that, positional information for the 
&gt; varous parts of the diagram? The only information that is given are 
&gt; positions of the nodes and the coordinates of the edges?
&gt;

Yes that is correct. The only exception being the 
speciesReferenceGlyphs that can specify a curve instead of just a 
bounding box.


&gt; Is there any information on objects other than modeling specific 
&gt; objects, or is this information reserved for the rendering info (see 
&gt; Jonathon's proposal for example).

First of all, the reference to objects in the model is optional for all 
Glyph objects, so you can have a CompartmentGlyph in the layout that 
does not reference a Compartment in the Model.
For all other objects that have absolutely nothing to do with reaction 
networks, we have the listOfAdditionalGraphicalObjects. So if you would 
like to include a picture of your red ferrari in the layout, you add 
some bounding box to this list and reference a bitmap of the car in the 
render parts listOfShapes.

&gt;
&gt; In the proposal you mention the bounding box but don't give an 
&gt; example. I can't easily read xml-schema, so I need to ask is the 
&gt; bounding box optional? I also notice you have a role attribute, is 
&gt; this optional?
&gt;

The bounding box that is mentioned is a set of attributes on the glyph 
objects. If you take for example the SpeciesGlyph it has the attributes 
x,y,z and w,h,d where z and d are optional and default to 0.0. The 
x,y,z attributes are used to set the position of the bounding box and 
the w,h,d are the width, height and depth respectively. The x,y,w and h 
attributes are not optional, so no, the bounding box is not optional.
The SpeciesReferenceGlyph is somewhat different since it can either 
have a bounding box object which again has the above mentioned 
attributes or it can have a curve that specifies the arrow that is used 
to represent the relation. Actually one of the two should be given, so 
there might be a mistake in the schema specification because there it 
would be optional.
The role attribute is indeed optional and it can be used to specify the 
role of the SpeciesReference in the reaction without having to figure 
it out from the kinetics. So if your program draws inhibitors 
differently from activators you could specify wether it is one or the 
other. If you use the render part as well, this would be redundant 
information since you would probably specify the complete render 
information there anyway.


&gt; The pseudo node coordinates I presume can coincide? I ask this because 
&gt; some of us don't use a straight line segment in the center of the 
&gt; reaction arc.
&gt;

Yes the two points of the reaction can coincide. Actually you can 
either see those two points as two pseudo nodes or as a bounding box. 
In the second case, you could specify some renderGroup (see render 
part) to be drawn inside this bounding box. Maybe this is a little 
ambiguous and should be changed.

&gt; Without rendering info, is there any recommandation for font sizes 
&gt; since you have width and height infor for node sizes, if the font size 
&gt; isn't chosen appropriately then the font will over flow the box. I 
&gt; think I would like to see something that indicates whether the node 
&gt; bounding box should be elastic or fixed, if elastic then the box will 
&gt; resize according to the font used. This is what I do in jdesigner and 
&gt; it avoids any font sizing issues.

This assumes that everybody will be drawing the nodes as text labels 
which might not be the case. Without render information it is up to the 
program what is drawn inside the bounding box.
I have not given any thought to elastic bounding boxes yet. Don't they 
defy the purpose of a bounding box? If I have some layout, so I want 
the program to be able to enlarge bounding boxes even though this might 
end up in a messy layout? If a text label would not fit into a given 
bounding box, would it not make more sense to have the layout 
recalculated?
What do other people think about his?


&gt; On first glance, I can't see anything which records the background 
&gt; colour? Do you have one?
&gt;
Short answer: not yet.
Longer answer: Since we did not specify concrete examples for shapes, 
we did not bother with their details yet. All the document states so 
far is that there will de an abstract class shape and that all shapes 
that will eventually be defined are subclasses of Shape. We are not 
sure yet if it would make sense to have an attribute for background 
color in Shape directly rather than in the subclasses (where needed). 
E.g. you might not need a background color for text label shapes or 
bitmaps. Actually depending on how we handle this, a background  color 
may not be needed at all. You could for example just draw some text on 
a filled rectangle that has the color you want as the background.


&gt; I was looking at the rendering document and noticed that most of it is 
&gt; in schema notation, probably I'm the only one but I find it difficult 
&gt; to read schema (it's like trying to read a C program that's written in 
&gt; assembler), would it be possible to put more real examples?
&gt;

I don't think you would be the only one having difficulties reading the 
schema notation and as you can see from the mistakes that I made 
writing it, I am not as comfortable with it as I would wish. Actually 
we had hoped that the text would make the points clear we were trying 
to make without having to rely on the schema. Obviously this is not the 
case and I apologize for that. As this is just a first draft and 
doesn't have all the features that are needed, it is somehow difficult 
to give examples. I tried to make up a short example towards the end to 
demonstrate how layout and render information would play together. For 
this I already made up some Shapes like text labels and circle, but as 
I just said, I made this just up for this example, we haven't defined 
any concrete shapes yet. We had hoped to get some feedback as to what 
kind of shapes people would need first. So could you tell us what kind 
of basic shapes you would like to have and the properties they need. As 
stated in the document, we are probably going to borrow some of the 
notation from SVG, we only need to know what is needed first.



I hope I could clarify some of the issues raised.
Thanks a lot for the feedback and we hope to hear more along this line

Ralph
