<PRE>
Come one, come all! Okay, time to kick off
the Diagrams Working Group! ANYONE
(INCLUDING those who signed up in Ft.
Lauderdale) who would like to participate
as a member, please email me privately:
jwagner@nso.uchc.edu
(I have the list from Ft. Lauderdale, but
want to make sure those who signed up
then are still interested enough to be
members).
Below you will find my first pass at a charter.
As it was written in a vacuum, I am expecting
feedback and modification. As this is a working
group charter, I will be restricting discussion
of it to working group members. I would like
feedback and modifications to be complete
by June 1, at which point we will get BUSY.
Two things I didn't want to charter until I got
feedback:
1) should the EXPECTED DELIVERABLE
state that the proposed specification will be
tested in prototypes (for proof of concept,
as well as detailed proof of implementation)?
2) upon presenting the completed specification
to the wider consortium, should the charter
state how discussion (and modifications)
will be handled, and what the outcome will
be?
Enquiring minds want to know! Weigh in
when you send me private email joining
the workgroup.
PROPOSED DIAGRAMS WORKING GROUP CHARTER
GOAL: The goal of the Diagrams Working Group (DWG)
is to develop an SBML Level 3 extension for representing
visual diagrams of SBML biochemical pathways.
CONTACT PERSON: The initial contact person is
John Wagner at University of Connecticut Health
Center.
EMail: jwagner@nso.uchc.edu
Tele: 860-679-2065 (ca. 10AM-5PM EST)
Keep in mind, however, that (for now, anyway) the
DWG discussions will be held via sbml-discuss,
and that everyone subscribing to that list is
encouraged to participate. I do expect this to
be a rather large working group, with extensive
email, so it is possible that it will be moved to
a separate list. All DWG members will be notified
if that happens, and will be automatically added
to that list. In the meantime, please ensure that
all DWG posts to sbml-discuss contain subject
lines including "DWG", as well as more specific
keywords, to lessen the impact on non-members.
INITIAL DWG MEMBERS: I have a list of members
who expressed interest at the last SBML meeting,
but to encourage participation among the entire
SBML consortium, I think it appropriate to solicit
membership now. All those interested in participating
in the DWG should email me (jwagner@nso.uchc.edu)
over the next few days (a simple, "Yo! DWG!" will
do), INCLUDING those who signed up at the last
SBML meeting.
EXPECTED DELIVERABLE: At the end of the DWG
effort, we will produce a proposed SBML Level 3
extension, in the form of a specification document
with unanimous support among DWG members,
for representing visual diagrams of SBML biochemical
pathways. This proposed specification will then be
presented to the entire SBML consortium for discussion
and modification.
EXPECTED TIMEFRAME: I would like to see a
specification document presented to the SBML
consortium by the end of summer. This should
give ample opportunity for general discussion
and evaluation before the next SBML meeting.
John Wagner
SBML DWG Chair
