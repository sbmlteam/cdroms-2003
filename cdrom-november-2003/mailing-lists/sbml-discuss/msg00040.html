Here's a reply to your questions:

&gt; 1. The E coli flux balance model associates one or more gene symbols,
&gt; enzyme names, and EC numbers with each reaction.  Right now the gene
&gt; symbols and enzyme name information is only in the annotations at the
&gt; beginning of the model, and since the suggestion to include 
&gt; the EC numbers
&gt; was not made until after I made this sample, those are not 
&gt; even in notes;
&gt; is there a way of incorporating the gene symbols, enzyme names, and EC
&gt; numbers into the model proper?  There are cases where more 
&gt; than one gene
&gt; is associated with a single reaction as well as cases where a 
&gt; single gene
&gt; is associated with several different reactions. 
&gt; 

SBML Level 2 uses the CellML metadata specification to define how
to attach this kind of data to a model.

<A  HREF="http://www.cellml.org/public/metadata/cellml_metadata_specification.html">http://www.cellml.org/public/metadata/cellml_metadata_specification.html</A>

In particular please look at the section

<A  HREF="http://www.cellml.org/public/metadata/general.html#sec_bio_entity">http://www.cellml.org/public/metadata/general.html#sec_bio_entity</A>

This section shows how to associate a resource with, for example,
a SWISS-PROT identifier.

An example is given:
<A  HREF="http://www.cellml.org/public/metadata/general.html#fig_bio_entity_exampl">http://www.cellml.org/public/metadata/general.html#fig_bio_entity_exampl</A>
e

That example could be incorporated into SBML Level 2 in the following
way:

&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;sbml xmlns="<A  HREF="http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level2">http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level2</A>"

  &lt;model name="simple"&gt;
    &lt;listOfCompartments&gt;
      &lt;compartment id="c1" /&gt;
    &lt;/listOfCompartments&gt;
    &lt;listOfSpecies&gt;
      &lt;species metaid="id0" id="X0" compartment="c1"
 				   boundaryCondition="true"
                        initialAmount="1"&gt;

				&lt;/cmeta:bio_entity&gt;
			&lt;/rdf:Description&gt;
		&lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;
      &lt;/species&gt;
    &lt;/listOfSpecies&gt;
REST OF MODEL GOES HERE

I'd be interested if you think we should extend the set of identifier
types
defined in the CellML specification.

&gt; 2.  The initialAmount value is not among those designated as Optional
&gt; in the species data type, so I have specified it as 0 in all cases.
&gt; The truth, however, is that initial Amounts are not in any 
&gt; way associated
&gt; with the flux balance model, and it would be more appropriate not to
&gt; specify any value.  Is it OK not to specify initialAmount values that
&gt; make no sense?
&gt;

SBML is designed to support a variety of network analyses and should
continue be extended to support more types of analysis.  It
is inevitable that there will data which essential for one type of
analysis and not for another.

An example of this is having kinetic laws optional: some connectivity
analysis can be performed without these laws.

Thus there is a strong argument that initialAmount should be also
optional.
This would be useful in that software can then decide if the model is
appropriate to it.  At the moment software can't tell if the species
amount is valid or not.
 
In the meantime I think it is acceptable to have incorrect values for
initial amounts although I would notify recipients that the model
doesn't
support certain analyses including conventional time based simulation.

&gt; 3. Many of the fluxes have lower and upper bounds for their 
&gt; values (which
&gt; can be both positive and negative).  These are not kinetic 
&gt; parameters but
&gt; are related to rates.  Although these can be adjusted to 
&gt; study the effects
&gt; of mutations, the default values are included in the native form flux
&gt; list. How do we represent these in SBML 2.0? 
&gt; 

There is no current mechanism for representing this in SBML Level 2.
Perhaps we should consider this for inclusion in this or future levels
of SBML.

In the meantime you should use a the annotation mechanism that is
described 
in the SBML Level 2 document for this data.

I hope this helps.  If you have any further questions please don't
hesitate to contact me.

Aside: In general I agree with Cliff Shafer's comments that variant
initial conditions and
parameters need to be stored separately from a model.  I think the model
should retain default values, particularly for publishing the best
estimates
and/or measurements for wild type organisms and to enable analyses to
operate
on a single file, for example download from the web, by default.
If we adopt a simple reference mechanism for parameters and initial
conditions
we can then have simple files that consist of sets of reference and
alternative
value pairs.

&gt; Subject: Some SBML 2.0 questions 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Hi Andrew,
&gt; 
&gt;      You seemed to be among those most conversant with the 
&gt; details of SBML
&gt; 2.0 at the recent MIT MDL working group meeting, so I am hopeful you
&gt; might be able to help me figure out some details in representing our E
&gt; coli flux balance model in SBML 2.0 for this Thursday's model example
&gt; submission deadline.  I actually sent the same set of questions to 
&gt; Cliff Shaffer, who is managing the model collection, last week, but I
&gt; expect the lack of response from him is likely due to his not being as
&gt; familiar with the workings of SBML 2.0 as you likely are.
&gt; 
&gt;     I have attached three files to illustrate the sort of information
&gt; we wish to represent and provided a manually produced attempt 
&gt; to represent
&gt; the same piece of the model provided in SBML 2.0.
&gt; 
&gt;     The first attachment is a tab-delimited file that shows a 
&gt; little piece
&gt; of the flux list we will submit as the major piece of the 
&gt; native form of
&gt; our model.  It happens that all the fluxes in this piece of 
&gt; the list are
&gt; associated with particular genes and enzymes and the reaction each
&gt; catalyzes, but there are also fluxes representing import and export of
&gt; compounds to and from the cell that will be represented with 
&gt; a different
&gt; sort of "reaction" (eg GLC[in] --&gt; GLC[out]), as well as fluxes like
&gt; "Growth" that end up being expressed in terms of Biomass.  I 
&gt; think I have
&gt; figured out how to represent each flux we will list in terms 
&gt; of some kind
&gt; of reaction.  
&gt; 
&gt;      The second attachment is a list of the abbreviations used in the
&gt; reactions mentioned in the first attachment (it includes many 
&gt; others as
&gt; well, but does not yet contain things like GLC[in] and 
&gt; GLC[out], but it
&gt; will.
&gt; 
&gt;       There final piece of the native form of the model is an 
&gt; objective
&gt; function, which will simply be 1 * Growth (where Growth is a flux
&gt; represented by a reaction involving biomass in the flux list we will
&gt; submit).  I assume we will likely just say that in the written brief
&gt; description of the model.  I do not know if there is a way of also
&gt; representing that in the SBML 2.0 version of the model.  Is there?
&gt; 
&gt;      The third attachment is the same set of fluxes as listed 
&gt; in the first
&gt; attachment represented in SBML 2.0.  It was prepared before we decided
&gt; everything that we would actually include in the submission, so it is
&gt; missing some things as well as including some things we will 
&gt; not attempt
&gt; to include in either the native model or the SBML 2.0 form of 
&gt; it.  Among
&gt; the things in this example that will not be found in the 
&gt; final submission
&gt; are some fluxes not central to the model, the wild type flux values
&gt; resulting from running the program on the model, and the 
&gt; pathway name for
&gt; this selection of fluxes, since that is not something 
&gt; actually used in the
&gt; model. Also, as I put this portion of the model into SBML manually, I
&gt; added parenthetical remarks about other names used for the gene in
&gt; question in the notes.  These will not appear in the automatically
&gt; generated SBML. 
&gt; 
&gt;      We found some things we could not figure out how to 
&gt; represent (other
&gt; than in notes) in the SBML 2.0 example, and have some SBML questions. 
&gt; 
&gt;      Here are the questions:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. The E coli flux balance model associates one or more gene symbols,
&gt; enzyme names, and EC numbers with each reaction.  Right now the gene
&gt; symbols and enzyme name information is only in the annotations at the
&gt; beginning of the model, and since the suggestion to include 
&gt; the EC numbers
&gt; was not made until after I made this sample, those are not 
&gt; even in notes;
&gt; is there a way of incorporating the gene symbols, enzyme names, and EC
&gt; numbers into the model proper?  There are cases where more 
&gt; than one gene
&gt; is associated with a single reaction as well as cases where a 
&gt; single gene
&gt; is associated with several different reactions. 
&gt; 
&gt; 2.  The initialAmount value is not among those designated as Optional
&gt; in the species data type, so I have specified it as 0 in all cases.
&gt; The truth, however, is that initial Amounts are not in any 
&gt; way associated
&gt; with the flux balance model, and it would be more appropriate not to
&gt; specify any value.  Is it OK not to specify initialAmount values that
&gt; make no sense?
&gt; 
&gt; 3. Many of the fluxes have lower and upper bounds for their 
&gt; values (which
&gt; can be both positive and negative).  These are not kinetic 
&gt; parameters but
&gt; are related to rates.  Although these can be adjusted to 
&gt; study the effects
&gt; of mutations, the default values are included in the native form flux
&gt; list. How do we represent these in SBML 2.0? 
&gt; 
&gt;     Thank you very much if you can help us answer these questions.
