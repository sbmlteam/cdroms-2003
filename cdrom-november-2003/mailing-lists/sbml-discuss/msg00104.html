I didn't notice there was a survey so didn't vote. Please put me down as
in favor of default compartments (if I understand the wording... this
sounds sort of like a double negative to me).

We need to be thinking ahead a bit here. The fact is that SBML is growing
and will grow more. There's basically two philosophies that such a
language can take: either its the union of everyone's needs or its the
intersection. I sense that this tension has always been understood, and
was initially unresolved or perhaps initially resolved in the favor of the
intersectionists. But recently the trend has very clearly moved in favor
of making it the union of modeling needs, and this is going to become
increasingly more so as we go into SBML Level 3.

It is a fundamental fact that we have to get used to the idea that there
are going to be features in the language such that soon EVERY model will
not be using all of the features. Compartments is perhaps our first clear
example of such a feature: some models need them now but many do not. We
do not want to set a bad precedent here. I think its a bad idea to require
those models WITHOUT any notion of compartments to put in a hack to
satisify that feature's requirements. Its especially unmotivating to hear
"its not that much work". Its not a sustainable precedent. Our models
should be saying which subset of features they need. They should not be
hacking around features that they don't need. For a model without a
concept of compartments to create a compartment to satisfy the syntax of
that feature is a poor idea in my opinion.

On the other hand, we could have a features list, and a non-compartment
model could be required to put in a statement like:

&lt;feature compartments FALSE&gt;
