Hi Vijay,


Thank you for the response.  This discussion is really a fun for me.


Well, the source of the fundamental difference between our ways of thinking is that
you are working on formal languages, while I am a numeric simulator writer.
Sometimes I find myself counting the number of possible assembler instructions and
pointer dereferences when I think about a new algorithm.   I don't think you 
think like this; you'd be rather thinking about formal consistency and the semantics
of possible language representations when you hit on the new algorithm :)


So,

&gt; (Almost) All programming language research has made a clear distinction 
&gt; between programs (syntax), their execution (operational semantics) and 
&gt; their meaning (denotational semantics) since the 60s. Logic, the basis 
&gt; of knowledge representation and modeling, has made a clear distinction 
&gt; between syntax and semantics at least since the days of Tarski.....

I completely agree on this.   I'm a computer scientist, basically.


&gt; &gt;Another possible view, however, is to see simulation algorithms as indivisible
&gt; &gt;parts of the models.    Every simulation model reflects its modeler's understanding
&gt; &gt;of certain real phenomenon, and it can be thought that some part of the 'understanding'
&gt; &gt;is implicitly coded in the computational procedure, or the simulation algorithm.
&gt; &gt;The same model can produce completely different results when driven by different
&gt; &gt;algorithms, and as we better understand the nature of the phenomenon, we becomes
&gt; &gt;to be able to create more suitable algorithms, or just to choose more appropriate algorithms
&gt; &gt;correctly.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I don't think these two views conflict.   These are just parallel understanding of the
&gt; &gt;same thing.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; I think they really conflict around inter-operability. 

AND I still think these don't conflict.
But wait, I admit I needed to clarify more about the difference between
these two viewpoints.

I was not talking about the syntax/semantics separation when I said algorithms
are parts of models, though I was when I said we must distinguish models
from implementations.   And I was not talking about languages.
When talking about formal languages and induction engines
it is the core concept, but in numerical simulators it is not always true.
You may agree that if we need to assure the interoperability, it should be 
done in the level of the higher level languages, not in data structures of
implementations.

I meant that when we choose to use differential equations it implicitly but definitely
indicate we understand, or at least we are trying to understand the dynamics of 
the model in terms of, continuous and deterministic computation (I meant this
by 'algorithm').   



&gt; So I would strongly encourage you to think hard about the semantics of 
&gt; your language. 
&gt; The fundamental question to ask is:  Can a user of your 
&gt; notation understand whether  the particular program s/he is writing (in 
&gt; your notation) is "correct" for the situation at hand, independent of 
&gt; his/her knowledge of the details of your execution engine ("operational 
&gt; semantics")?

Of course this is a very important point.   
Design of my software is layered; its language (EML) is basically just
persistence of its simulator object model,
and on top of that another higher level of semantic representation will be built (or just
use SBML when it is ready to cover all the functionalities of the
software).


&gt; Though perhaps a point of agreement is that annotations to models may 
&gt; certainly include references to preferred or known execution engines 
&gt; that can be used with them. i.e. notes on the usage of the model. This 
&gt; "pragmatic" view is perhaps a way to bridge the "conceptual" gap.

Yes, this is what I was going to propose.   
And I think there are some levels:   the model just 'can' be run with that
algorithm, or the algorithm 'must' be used for it to guarantee validity
of the model.   Or there can also be a 'should' level.   
Another a bit more sophisticated, but slightly smells like the 'design by committee'
antipattern, is to force all simulation engines to declare their capabilities in detail, 
and let the model to indicate what is the requirement to run it correctly.


&gt; &gt;Importance of the 'continuous/discrete hybrid' of course does not decreases
&gt; &gt;here.  Rather the multi-algorithm framework is-a hybrid (I mean it is a subclass),
&gt; &gt;and it is indispensable to elegantly design and implement it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Certainly the choice of the phrase "Hybrid Systems" to name the sub-area 
&gt; we are talking about is highly unfortunate: each of the words is widely 
&gt; applicable, as well as the combination. But given that this choice is 
&gt; made, I would recommend not fighting it, but looking for other technical 
&gt; names to name different concepts.

In device simulation, such as SPICE, a hybrid electronic/electric
digital/analog simulator, they call it mixed-mode.     
(I used to call multi-algorithm mixed-mode, but I quited using this
 term  for E-Cell when I knew they use it to mean this.)

I think this is a fairly common term in that community.   I'm not sure this is
the best name for us, though.



regards,
-Kouichi
