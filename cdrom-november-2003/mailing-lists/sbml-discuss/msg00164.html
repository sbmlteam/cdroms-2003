Hello all,

we thank you very much for all your feedback to the SBML diagram layout 
proposal during the  last days. 

Pedros suggestion to add z-coordinates to all objects definitely makes sense 
and does not do any harm since it can easily be ignored by programs that 
don´t use it. 

About Stefans proposal to include color and shape information: 
With our design we tried to separate several levels of information. First 
level is obviously standard SBML which describes the reaction network without 
any layout information. 
Second level (the layout level, which is what we describe in our document) 
contains only information about the layout of the reaction scheme, not about 
how it is rendered. This seems to fit the information that John mentioned in 
his last mail. This would be exactly the information that an automatic layout 
algorithm would deal with. 
Third level (the render level, which we didn´t specify yet) would contain 
anything about how a specific object is rendered. This includes color, shape, 
pixmaps, ...

The reason why we chose to separate these levels is that we think it should be 
comparably easy to agree on a format for the second level (layout 
information). We could have a working and stable version of that soon. The 
third level (render information) would deal with a lot more details and it 
will certainly take longer time to reach an agreement. 

About the modifiers:
On the layout level  we see no reason to treat modifiers different from 
substrates or products. SBML L2 already works that way (as Andrew pointed 
out). On the render level of course different programs will have different 
ideas of how to draw a reaction with a modifier. We are not shure yet where 
the information whether a modifier is an activator or an inhibitor belongs. I 
tend to put it in the layout level but that needs some more discussion. 

About several layouts for one model: We haven´t thought about that yet and 
would very much like to see suggestions.

we will send an updated proposal soon.

Sven
