Dear all

One of the things that we should keep in mind is how such concepts as 
'arrays' or other collections mesh in with the rest of the language 
components. Given that MathML is currently used to specify 
relationships between SBML variables, and given that MathML already 
defines a useful set of collections (vectors, matrices, sets, lists) 
that are well integrated with the rest of the MathML language, I would 
strongly suggest that careful consideration be given to using MathML 
collections as the model for SBML collections. I believe that a 
one-to-one correspondence between MathML and SBML collection constructs 
would greatly ease the meshing of collections in SBML.

As I mentioned in the Fort Lauderdale talk, these ideas may not be 
sensible to discuss in isolation from the more general notion of 
introducing typing or classing mechanisms into the language. But that 
is an even bigger problem to tackle...

Best wishes
Poul

&gt;
&gt; Andrew,
&gt;
&gt; I'd like to participate in the "Arrays" working group, although I would
&gt; prefer it be called the "Collections" working group so as not to
&gt; prejudge the answer to your question about whether they should allow
&gt; Sets, Bags, OrderedCollections, Sorted Collections, Dictionaries, etc.
&gt;
&gt; My own view, which is biased by my experience doing simulations in
&gt; Smalltalk rather than C, is that Arrays improperly mix three separate
&gt; concepts: collections, indexing and iteration.
&gt;
&gt; - The Collection concept provides the ability to refer to a bunch 
&gt; (i.e.,
&gt; collection) of elements as "one thing,"  typically when the program
&gt; needs to pass the whole bunch at once, e.g., as an argument, to some
&gt; function.
&gt;
&gt; - The indexing concept is about how to refer to a particular element.
&gt; In many cases, especially when the collection contains elements that 
&gt; are
&gt; distributed evenly in space or time, naming the elements with an 
&gt; integer
&gt; is exactly what you want to do.  But when the natural organization of
&gt; the elements is not isomorphic to a one-dimensional physical axis with
&gt; evenly spaced elements, integers become cryptic and arbitrary names 
&gt; that
&gt; don't offer much modeling power.  So, for example, a Dictionary is a
&gt; collection in which names (or keys) other than integers can be used.
&gt; [note, the implementation of a dictionary is usually a relatively 
&gt; sparse
&gt; array in which the names are converted to indices by a hash function]
&gt;
&gt; - The iteration concept is about the order in which a program wishes to
&gt; access, store, or modify the elements, usually with the implicit
&gt; understanding that all elements are to be dealt with.  For example, in
&gt; an OrderedCollection, iteration is intended to start at the first
&gt; element and proceed successively to the end (or sometimes backwards 
&gt; from
&gt; last to first).  In a SortedCollection, the intent is to start with the
&gt; smallest element (not smallest index) and proceed to the largest 
&gt; (again,
&gt; one may want to go backwards).  Other kinds of collection (e.g., Set or
&gt; Bag) explicitly ignore order, i.e., they explicitly assert that the
&gt; order of iteration is undefined or irrelevant.
&gt;
&gt; At the implementation level, when a simulation is running,  arrays are
&gt; almost always the implementation of choice.  SBML, however, is a model
&gt; description language quite separate from the simulation.  It seems to 
&gt; me
&gt; that modelers might like to be able to make richer or more nuanced
&gt; statements about indexing and iteration than those allowed by Arrays.
&gt; They may want to index elements by names rather than integers.  They 
&gt; may
&gt; want to indicate that the order in which the elements appear in the XML
&gt; text is, or is not, important.  They may want to indicate that 
&gt; iteration
&gt; should proceed in a sort order, e.g., smallest to largest, however the
&gt; elements appear in the list of XML.  And so forth.  Thus, if SBML
&gt; allowed collection tags other than Array, the modeler could use them to
&gt; indicate to the consumer of the model whether the order of elements in
&gt; the list is important or not. If it allowed Dictionaries, one could use
&gt; /key and /value tags to name elements rather than referring to them 
&gt; with
&gt; some arbitrary integer.

&gt;
&gt; Charter of the SBML Arrays Working Group
&gt; ----------------------------------------
&gt;
&gt; Background
&gt;
&gt; At the recent SBML forum meeting in Florida it was decided to setup
&gt; working groups to develop proposals for incorporation into SBML.
&gt; Several people at the meeting signed up to a working group to develop a
&gt; proposal for arrays in SBML
&gt;
&gt; Mission Statement and Scope
&gt;
&gt; Definition of an extension to SBML to allow the construction
&gt; of models from homogeneous collections of objects.  Attributes of these
&gt; objects can vary systematically across these collections.
&gt;
&gt; Any viable proposal must:
&gt;
&gt; - support a mechanism for describing the connections between array
&gt; elements
&gt; - be compatible with other proposals in particular model composition 
&gt; and
&gt; dynamic structures
&gt;
&gt; Main issues to resolve:
&gt;
&gt; - What objects can occur in these collections?
&gt; - What is the correct mechanism for defining collections?
&gt;              for example should we consider sets, bags etc as
&gt; alternatives
&gt;              to arrays.
&gt; - Do we need syntactic sugar to simplify the use of or compress the
&gt; encoding of arrays?
&gt; - Should a function for defining the sparseness of an array be dynamic
&gt;              (vary during simulation)?
&gt;
&gt; Termination criterion:
&gt;
&gt;    Arrays is included into the SBML Level 3
&gt;
&gt;    or
&gt;
&gt;    The idea is considered as nonsense for Systems-Biology and dropped
&gt;    from the SBML Agenda
&gt;
&gt;    Timeframe: I expect a working proposal and first reference
&gt;    implementations for the next SBML Forum Meeting in
&gt;    Nov 2003 S. Louis
&gt;
&gt; Deliverables:
&gt;
&gt;    - a Array proposal for incorporation into SBML L3
&gt;    - a reference implementation that can read and write the proposed
&gt; standard including L2 in a
&gt;      useful software context
&gt;    - at least one published model encoded in the proposal
&gt;    - optional: a tool that can translate from the proposed standard
&gt; including SBML L2 to
&gt;      unextended SBML L2.
