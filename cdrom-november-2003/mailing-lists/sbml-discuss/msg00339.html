The whole reason for including a resolution was so that
we wouldn't need to specify units--all units would be in
"points". Also, I didn't say we should use 1/72 as the
standard unit, I said it should be specified and, in the
event it wasn't, then the default should be 1/72, but really,
I prefer to simply specify that the units are in points (72
DPI), and then not allow it to be specified. Originally,
I thought, why not let people read/write in their own
units (like Herbert's 96 DPI), but then I realized, that
would only be of benefit when writing; when reading,
you'd still be forced to convert to your units from the
units specified in the SBML file.
 
So yeah, I agree--units should be set in stone as "points"
and not allowed to be overridden; this also gets us out
of the political argument over metric v. English.
 
I also agree that we shouldn't throw things in just because
they are convenient; in this case, it's not a matter just of
convenience, it's a need for certain types of tools (the
printer tool was a good example), and a convenience
for others.
 
As for Eric's suggestion about compound role, I think
we're going to have to really think about this, and hard,
the principal problem being that currently, the Species
and SpeciesReference elements have no way of specifying
such info, so we can't just say it belongs there unless
everyone is willing to not have such info until the Species/
SpeciesReference are changed. On the other hand, if that
is where we decide such things go, then we will expand
the scope of the DWG group to include "fixing" those.
But as I said, we need to really think hard about this.
How do we start? Maybe Eric could put together a
fairly detailed description of requirements/wants?

	OK, now I guess I understand. The problem is, we tried to limit the
	layout information to the parts that are "absolutely" necessary which
	obviously did not include units as was pointed out by Herbert Sauro and
	John Wagner. I am not really sure, if we really have all the necessary
	bits and I hope that we will continue to get feedback about it.
	Now some people start to miss bits that can be specified as
	"convenient". So we have to decide wether this information should
	really be put into the layout part, or if it would not better fit
	somewhere else like in the render information (to be specified) or the
	model itself.
	I guess if units were to be put somewhere it would rather be in the
	layout part then in the render information, so if everybody could agree
	that having optional units specified for the layout information, we
	will put it there.
	I also had a look at the SVG specification and they seem to use pixel
	as the standard unit if no other unit is specified. All measures in SVG
	can be given in different units. In my opinion this would be an
	overkill for SBML and I think it would be easiest to agree on the
	suggestion made by John Wagner to use 1/72 inch as the standard unit.
	So what do others think? Should units be included or should we just
	agree that all values are 1/72 of an inch and if programs don't like
	that, they can do whatever they want? And if we want unit support, do
	people really need to be able to specify units in pt, mm, inch etc.?
	As to the suggestion mad by Eric Minch on including information about
	the role of certain compounds, I personally think this information does
	not belong into the layout part. I think this should rather be put into
	the model if necessary (e.g. a new attribute in reaction that specifies
	wether this is a transport or an attribute in SpeciesReference that
	determines the role of the modifier (if it is used as one).
	If this information is just used for rendering purposes, it should go
	with the render information.
	Any thoughts on this?

	&gt;
	&gt;       Maybe I am missing something here, but the point we are trying to make
	&gt;       is that specifying units should not be necessary if all measures are
	&gt;       given relative to each other. OK, I am going to try to explain it in a
	&gt;       little more detail, maybe someone can tell me where I am wrong.
	&gt;       Lets assume, we have an sbml file with layout information and the
	&gt;       largest x and y values are 2000,1500 respectively. And we also have
	&gt;       some species reference that has a bounding box of size 200x70. Now in
	&gt;       the render information of this bounding box, a font is specified as
	&gt;       being of size 36 (which is just a relative size, not an absolute one).
	&gt;       Now I have a program that needs to render this on screen and I want
	&gt;       this font to be a 12pt font on the screen.
	&gt;       So the fontsize given as 36 would be equal to 12pt, this would mean
	&gt;       that I just scale all the other values by 1/3, so on the screen my
	&gt;       canvas would be 2000/3 x 1500/3 points and the bounding box of the
	&gt;       species reference would be 200/3 x 70/3 point in size.
	&gt;       Now if for any reason I would decide that 12pt is to small and I would
	&gt;       rather have an 18pt font, I would not divide be 3, but by 2.
	&gt;       The point is, I do not specify an absolute size for a font, but a size
	&gt;       that is relative to the bounding box, so if I scale the whole diagram,
	&gt;       the fonts scale (in theory) nicely as well. (Assuming, that you don't
	&gt;       have to substitute fonts.)
	&gt;       We actually don't have any problem with specifying some unit in the
	&gt;       file, we just don't understand the necessity for it.
	&gt;       I fear, that this explanation was not much better than the last one,
	&gt;       but maybe someone can figure it out and tell me where I am wrong.

	&gt;       &gt; I don';t quite understand the argument in 1). Because the dimensions
	&gt;       &gt; have no
	&gt;       &gt; units we have no idea how big the 200*50 node actually is, the user
	&gt;       &gt; might
	&gt;       &gt; have drawn is as 200 meters by 50 meters (unlikely!). The 10pt font
	&gt;       &gt; size
	&gt;       &gt; however has a physical size. I'm not sure how scaling can help
	&gt; because
	&gt;       &gt; we
	&gt;       &gt; don't know by how much to scale unless you are implying that the
	&gt;       &gt; dimensions
	&gt;       &gt; do have some units? The problem is we're mixing dimensionless units
	&gt;       &gt; with
	&gt;       &gt; units with real units, I can't think at the moment of any way to
	&gt;       &gt; relate them
	&gt;       &gt; with out making some assumption about the dimensionless units.
	&gt;       &gt;
	&gt;       &gt; In your example I don't understand the scaling from 200*50 to 100*25
	&gt;       &gt; because
	&gt;       &gt; the font is 20pt? It looks like you're dividing by 2 and multiplying
	&gt;       &gt; by 10
	&gt;       &gt; (in relation to the font size). The 20pt font is 20/72 inches high,
	&gt;       &gt; however
	&gt;       &gt; we have no idea how high a 200 unit node is?
	&gt;       &gt; I'm missing something here I think, could you explain your approach
	&gt; a
	&gt;       &gt; bit
	&gt;       &gt; more.

	&gt;       &gt; 1.) Units
	&gt;       &gt;
	&gt;       &gt; Maybe we miss some point but in our opinion it should not be
	&gt; necessary
	&gt;       &gt; to specify units for diagrams. If all size constraints are specified
	&gt;       &gt; relative to each other the diagram (including fonts) can be scaled
	&gt; to
	&gt;       &gt; any resolution the user/application wants. Lets say we have a node
	&gt; as
	&gt;       &gt; a text label, then we could specify the size of the node as being
	&gt; 200
	&gt;       &gt; * 50 and the font being of size 20. Now, if we want to represent the
	&gt;       &gt; text label with a 10pt font, this would mean that the node would
	&gt; have
	&gt;       &gt; to be rescaled to have the size 100 * 25. If the application doesn't
	&gt;       &gt; want the font to scale with the rest of the diagram, the render
	&gt;       &gt; information for the font could e.g. include an attribute called
	&gt;       &gt; "fixed".
	&gt;       &gt;
	&gt;       &gt;
	&gt;       &gt; 2.) SVG as layout format
	&gt;       &gt;
	&gt;       &gt; When we first discussed creating a layout extension for SBML, we
	&gt; also
	&gt;       &gt; looked at SVG in order to store the pathway diagram/graph (that was
	&gt;       &gt; also a reason why we did not include a 3rd dimension in the first
	&gt;       &gt; draft). Finally, we dropped this alternative mainly because of the
	&gt;       &gt; following reason: SVG is a vector graphics format and not a graph
	&gt;       &gt; format. SVG does not allow to specify relations between objects as
	&gt;       &gt; would be needed e.g. by any (reaction) graph or network.
	&gt;       &gt;
	&gt;       &gt;
	&gt;       &gt; 3.) Using SVG tags as render information
	&gt;       &gt;
	&gt;       &gt; Although the complete SVG would probably be an overkill, we agree
	&gt; that
	&gt;       &gt; part of the SVG specification could be used as rendering
	&gt;       &gt; information(elements like e.g. circles, defs,...). One point that
	&gt;       &gt; should be considered is whether the individual SVG elements can
	&gt; easily
	&gt;       &gt; be extended to port 3D information or if we want to limit ourselfs
	&gt; to
	&gt;       &gt; 2D rendering information.
	&gt;       &gt;
	&gt;       &gt; 4.) MathML rendering
	&gt;       &gt;
	&gt;       &gt; There was the question whether there are any libraries that deal
	&gt; with
	&gt;       &gt; rendering MathML. So far the only free widget that we found is a GTK
	&gt;       &gt; widget(GtkMathView).
	&gt;       &gt; The alternative would be to convert the MathML to LaTeX, run LaTex
	&gt; and
	&gt;       &gt; convert the resulting DVI file to a bitmap file. For this there are
	&gt;       &gt; free tools, but no libraries.
	&gt;       &gt; For further tools see: <A  HREF="http://www.w3.org/Math/implementations.html">http://www.w3.org/Math/implementations.html</A>
