I also agree that the definition must be unanbiguous. However, I think
this discussion has been centering more on the molecular issues rather
than the dynamics issues. If the spec intends to cover the molecular
interactions then the only way to go would be by identifying and
classifying binding sites (which is not unanbiguous). And as has been seen
by the discussion, this is not so easy. For example enzymes often contain
non-specific binding sites and it will be nearly impossible to capture
what can bind there. Overall I think that going molecular is a mistake;
leave that for CML and others who are much more likely to cover molecular
interactions in much better ways. SBML has always been intended for
dynamic models (even when these are disguised as structural, as in
elementary flux modes which are actually defined by a dynamics criterion).
In dynamics what matters is if a species affects a rate of reaction and
how. In a model it is important to distinguish between those species that
affect the rate directly versus the ones that affect it through the
network. Note that this distinction is relative to the model. So if my
model that has the PFK enzyme includes AMP but not ATP (strange but
possible) I would indicate that AMP is a modifier of the PFK reaction; but
if ATP is also included in the model, then it is ATP that is the modifier,
not AMP (since AMP affects the rate by the ADK reaction with ATP and AMP).
By the way, SBML is not a biochemistry textbook and so should allow for
anyone to be able to define models that may not conform to what is
commonly accepted biochemistry...

Regarding the other issue of substrates (or products) that are also
modifiers. This is indeed a more delicate problem. From my perspective I
would label all modifiers as such, even if they are also substrates or
products. And in Gepasi this is easy to do since the *species roles* are
separated from the *species* in the rate laws (the more I see these
discussions the more I like toi have made this choice!) This means that
rate laws are defined with symbols that are not the species names. Then
the species are assigned to those symbols that are substrates, products
and modifiers. This lets me write a rate law such as: V*S/(K+S+M)  and
then assign the same species to S and M. It is the symbols S and M that
are labeled as substrate and modifier, not the species that is assigned to
them (which in this case has both roles). This requires a level of
abstraction from the part of the user, but that has not scared away a good
number of users that are not mathematical modeling experts from Gepasi,
so...

I vote for enumerating all modifiers even when they are substrates.
However given that SBML is already broken regarding this, I can easily
accept the other option.

(it is broken because in SBML the rate laws include names or IDs of
species directly and thus this distinction becomes meaningless as you may
understand from the example above).

PS- I posted only to sbml-discuss given I donÂ¥t take part in the biospice
discussions, but feel free to forward this to that list (however I would
really like to read the answers, unless this becomes a biospice only
issue)

&gt; I agree with Herbert's take on this: things should be unambiguous. Can we
&gt; come up with some test cases and look at how the proposed specification
&gt; would handle some potential problem situations involving modifiers doing
&gt; other things ? Here is another:  on PDE5, cGMP is a substrate and it also
&gt; binds to an allosteric site on PDE5 to modify the enzymatic rates.

&gt;&gt; I think we probably need a more sophisticated means of specifying
&gt;&gt; modifiers. I'm not against some type of modifier list but it's
&gt;&gt; application
&gt;&gt; is limited at the moment (very limited!), I'm not sure if anyone uses it
&gt;&gt; other than a lazy means to parsing the rate law (not an issue in Level 2
&gt;&gt; I
&gt;&gt; believe anyway). Could we make it optional if there is a rate law, but
&gt;&gt; compulsory if there isn't a rate law?

&gt;&gt; &gt; Rate laws are optional - in which case its not possible to determine
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt; modifiers.
&gt;&gt; &gt; And for better or worse the community decided even with rate laws the
&gt;&gt; &gt; list of modifiers were
&gt;&gt; &gt; required in Level 2.
