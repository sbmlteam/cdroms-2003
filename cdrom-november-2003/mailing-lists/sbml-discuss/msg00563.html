Herbert,
We do that, too, so I'll try to answer this one...
In our GUI, when the user wants to create a reaction,
they drop a reaction object on the canvas, and then
hooks species into it. The reaction glyph has three
"hotspots" where species can be hooked in: one for
reactants, one for products, and one for catalysts
(modifiers). This makes it much easier to program,
and allows for a fairly clean user interaction ITO
specifying reactions.
Thus, their "center segment" is the graphical
representation of a reaction, and all the other
lines flowing in and out are the graphical
representation of "species participation in a
reaction" (if you will).
This is a bit different from how you do it in
JDesigner, but as I say, it's exactly how we
do it in the virutal cell. That's why I said
we needed a spec that addressed both approaches.

Hope that helps,
John

&gt; 
&gt; I look at your picture and wondered why you need to visually 
&gt; indicate the center segment? Also why have a separate central 
&gt; segment? Why not join the arcs directly? Is there some 
&gt; biological significance to this?

&gt; 
&gt; 	Hello, 
&gt; 
&gt; 	it seems that, again, we will have to make some general 
&gt; decision: 
&gt; 	Do we want to have several ways to represent reactions 
&gt; in our layout (to 
&gt; 	reflect the different way existing programs deal with 
&gt; reactions) or do we 
&gt; 	want to find one way to represent reactions. 
&gt; 	The one way would need to be fairly general to allow 
&gt; most other cases to be 
&gt; 	translated. It would therefore be unnecessarily complex 
&gt; for some simple 
&gt; 	cases. 
&gt; 
&gt; 	In our proposal we tried to find a compromise between 
&gt; generality and 
&gt; 	simplicity: 
&gt; 	A graphical representation of a reaction in our 
&gt; proposal consists of the 
&gt; 	coordinates of exactly two nodes. One node is where the 
&gt; substrate arcs meet, 
&gt; 	the other is where the product arcs meet. Optionally 
&gt; information about the 
&gt; 	curve connecting the nodes could be given (not yet in 
&gt; our proposal). Also the 
&gt; 	graphical representation of the reaction contains a 
&gt; list of graphical 
&gt; 	representations of species references. These contain 
&gt; information on which 
&gt; 	species glyphs connect to which node of the graphical 
&gt; representation of the 
&gt; 	reaction. Optionally also information on the form of the curve. 
&gt; 	(In the attached figure the red squares are the nodes 
&gt; of the graphical 
&gt; 	representaion of the reaction. The green curves are the 
&gt; graphical 
&gt; 	representations of the species references. The blue 
&gt; circles are the graphical 
&gt; 	representations of species. So the red and green 
&gt; objects together form the 
&gt; 	graphical repsresentation of the reaction) 
&gt; 
&gt; 	Of course more general graphical representations of 
&gt; reactions could be thought 
&gt; 	of (like an arbitrary number of nodes in the reaction). 
&gt; 
&gt; 	If a program internally deals with only one node 
&gt; (center of reaction) it could 
&gt; 	either give the two nodes the same coordinates or 
&gt; regard them as one point 
&gt; 	plus a tangent. 
&gt; 
&gt; 	So what do you think? Do we need a more general 
&gt; definition? Do we need several 
&gt; 	cases for simple reactions and complicated reactions? 
&gt; Or could there be a 
&gt; 	compromise similar to our proposal? 
&gt;

&gt; 	&gt; You're correct, Jdesigner does have an explict 
&gt; reaction section, instead 
&gt; 	&gt; the whole line from reactants to products represents 
&gt; the reaction, thus 
&gt; 	&gt; clicking anywhere on the line will bring up the 
&gt; reaction property box. No 
&gt; 	&gt; harm though in allowing people to have special 
&gt; symbols or sections of the 
&gt; 	&gt; line that represent the reaction. 
&gt; 	&gt;

&gt; 	&gt;       Herbert 
&gt; 	&gt; 
&gt; 	&gt;       &gt;I also agree with Herbert et al about line 
&gt; placement, but we 
&gt; 	&gt;       &gt;need to think pretty hard about it so that 
&gt; everyone is happy. 
&gt; 	&gt;       &gt;For example, JDesigner (as I recall) doesn't have a 
&gt; 	&gt;       &gt;graphical representation for the reaction; 
&gt; instead, the 
&gt; 	&gt;       &gt;reaction is represented by the collection of lines in 
&gt; 	&gt;       &gt;an implicit manner. On the other hand, the 
&gt; Virtual Cell 
&gt; 	&gt;       &gt;group takes an approach similar to the EML 
&gt; approach, with 
&gt; 	&gt;       &gt;two (x, y) points representing the reaction (one point 
&gt; 	&gt;       &gt;where reactants hook in, one where products hook in). 
&gt; 	&gt;       &gt;I think we need to treat both approaches.
