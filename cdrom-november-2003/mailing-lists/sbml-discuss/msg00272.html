SVG does have a limited set of shapes
see <A  HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/shapes.html">http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/shapes.html</A>

I admit that triangles are not listed

&gt; One thing I didn't like about SVG was the lack of support for 
&gt; predefined shapes such as triangles, hexagons etc. I know one 
&gt; can specify then using straight coordinates but ....

&gt; 
&gt; As I said, I had only looked at it recently,
&gt; but at the time I wasn't really thinking about
&gt; using SVG in its entirety, just maybe borrowing
&gt; pieces of it. SVG is a spec for painting vector-
&gt; based graphics, whereas what we want is something
&gt; that tells us how to lay out our pathways--far
&gt; less difficult, and much more specific.
&gt; 
&gt; Some of its constructs, however, could be
&gt; useful. For example, how it specifies colors,
&gt; shapes, lines/curves could be used to our
&gt; purposes. For example, I kind of like their
&gt; &lt;defs&gt;...&lt;/defs&gt;, something *like* that could
&gt; be useful for defining standard shapes/elements.
&gt; 
&gt; As to my first point, about lots of optional
&gt; detail...my idea is that we allow tools to
&gt; export a fairly detailed description of their
&gt; diagram(s), and, upon importing a model, they
&gt; can simply ignore anything they don't want to
&gt; (or can't) deal with. For example, the Virtual
&gt; Cell will export many, many diagrams, all but
&gt; one of which JDesigner will iggy. When JDesigner
&gt; exports a layout, it might specify that species
&gt; are to be drawn as red rectangles with black
&gt; borders; the Virtual Cell, when it imports that
&gt; layout, will say, "Herbert wanted red rects with
&gt; black borders...bummer...looks like little yellow
&gt; circles it is". This fits with the idea of allow-
&gt; ing a very fine level of detail in the diagrams.
&gt; 
&gt; Best example is the size thing: let's allow a
&gt; size to be specified, and any tool that doesn't
&gt; have a size-based approach can simply iggy it.

&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; I can live with SVG so long as someone is willing to write
&gt; &gt; the parser for it
&gt; &gt; (portable C please), it's not pure XML so it might be some 
&gt; work at the
&gt; &gt; software end.

&gt; &gt; Subject: [sbml-discuss] DWG preliminary issues
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; First, it looks like we are not going to use the forum. Several 
&gt; &gt; members expressed that they'd much prefer to use email. 
&gt; (That's why I 
&gt; &gt; didn't reply to your email earlier, Pedro.)
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; That said, without an indexing by working group
&gt; &gt; and topic, this is pretty unworkable, especially
&gt; &gt; given the tremendous volume of discussion now
&gt; &gt; and, most likely, in the future; 39 of my last 50
&gt; &gt; email messages have been sbml-discuss--and I
&gt; &gt; have purposefully not sent any DWG messages
&gt; &gt; out. What a complete pain in the ass.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; Now, for the preliminary issues:
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; 1. It appears that some groups want a LOT of
&gt; &gt; flexibility in diagrams, others want very little.
&gt; &gt; Can we all agree on the general approach of
&gt; &gt; "lots of optional details"?
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; 2. A number of people have suggested SVG
&gt; &gt; might be a viable approach. I hadn't read up
&gt; &gt; on it until recently, but now that I have, I can
&gt; &gt; see some distinct advantages. What is everyone's
&gt; &gt; initial view on this: do you think SVG would
&gt; &gt; be a good/viable approach, or would it be
&gt; &gt; too much of a pain in the butt for people to
&gt; &gt; jump on board?
