I'd like to come to your meeting when I'd like
discuss some of the issues you raised below.

Please could you give directions to your room on the JPL site.
I will be arriving by the 177 bus at approx 9:30am.

Can I get onto the JPL site with my Caltech Id?

yours Andrew

Hello Andrew.

Following are my thoughts on your comments.

First about connections.
You are right, the example I presented has every cell connected to it adjacent 
neighbor and does not need explicit connection mechanism. But there are biological
systems were explicit connections would need to be specified,
that is why I have suggested before connections of three types:"explicit", 
"function_based" or "complete". And even though neither "complete" nor 
"function_based" connections need explicit list of connections, "explicit" 
type would need all the connections listed. So, we must maintain some sort of
&lt;listOfConnections&gt; element, where all types of connections can be specified.

You proposed that connections are best thought of as sparse arrays. From the 
viewpoint of SBML it does not matter, I suppose. But translator from SBML2 to 
SBML1 will care, and it can be sparse matrix if you wish or linked list. 
Now about your "elementOccurs" proposition, why keep renaming things? I thought 
we have agreed already that &lt;listOfConnections&gt; can be defined within any 
array element (or any element that can have a listOfDimensions element),
so why rename it with "elementOccurs"? Do you think it is a more descriptive 
name? Moreover, I still believe that formula is not an only method to define 
where connection occurs. For example, in neuron interactions formula will not do, 
we will need explicit connections. Or am I not understanding something?

Now about functions. The type of the functions you introduced in the example do 
not worry me too much. Those are easy functions: just a formula and an 
arguments, they can be easily avoided by listing formulas in place. If such
formula has to be repeated many times, then such short functions (in essence - 
macros) can be useful. Nevertheless, in-place code is more readable if formula 
appears only once. For our example, I think, functions like you proposed do not 
simplify things, but they might for other examples. On the other hand, 
functions that worry me a lot are functions like "sum" in our example. They are
more complicated; while interpreted they require loops and tracing of various 
data structures. Those are the functions, I would like to avoid expanding in 
SBML. They require traditional programming and I think they are better to be
expanded in interpreters. So what that there will be "profusion of standard 
functions defined inside the language"? Many languages, especially high level
specialized languages have such profusion of standard functions (matlab for 
example). So, why can't we have "biolab" library which includes all these 
functions. I am sure that biologist have a lot of structures and operations 
that they all use repeatedly and would like to have some "short hand" for them.
For example, SBML1 has an entire list of rate law functions already, so why 
can't we have more functions of different types. For example, connection 
functions can automate summing or product over the immediate neighbors, or 
X-degree neighbors, or over explicit connections. Once one biologist needs such 
function, the chances are that others also will need it.

Any way, On Thursday, 10:00 am, I will discuss these issues with members of 
my group. Let's see what they will say. Do you want to come to the meeting too?
It will be at JPL.

Victoria.
