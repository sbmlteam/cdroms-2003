Hello, Andrew.

First of all, I would like to let you know that I have not written a 
transformation to level 1 for given example. On the contrary, the level 1
representation for specified model was produced by Bruce Shapiro's cellerator.
I only took his SBML level1 example, back-engineered formulas that he used 
and made up a concise SBML level 2 example for same formulas. But it is true,
that while doing it, I always kept thinking of how the interpretor 
transforming level2 into level1 will work.

Now, about issues raced in your comments. First easy ones:
1) empty brackets"[]" notation is indeed redundant.
"List of dimensions" already tells you that the element above is an array.
I also think that &lt;dimension symbol="[ii]"...&gt; that you included in your 
example is also redundant. It is enough to specify species as following:
 
    &lt;listOfSpecies&gt;
      &lt;specie name="s" initialAmount="0" compartmentReference="cell"&gt;
        &lt;listOfDimensions&gt;
           &lt;dimension rangeReference ="i" /&gt;
	&lt;/listOfDimensions&gt;
      &lt;/specie&gt;
    &lt;/listOfSpecies&gt;

Since we already know that cell is a one dimensional array, we can
interpret above statement as create a specie array for EACH element of cell array.
And if you insist we can refer to this "two dimensional array" as you did in your 
example as s[K][i]. But I would still prefer "cell[K].s[i]" because of following 
reason: specie concentrations are inside the cell and it is logical to think
of them as cell attributes. This inside/outside relationship is naturally depicted
by "." as  "cell[K].s[i]". Keeping species in a separate 2-dimensional array is also
possible. What do other people think?

2) I did started out by including symbol for each dimension just like you suggest, 
but I quickly figured that I usually need more then one name for each dimension 
(just like you said). I think it is cleaner code if dimension always refers to range 
name and ranges are listed separately, but it does not matter much to me one way or 
the other. Both work.

3) I agree with your suggestions about &lt;listOfInstances&gt; and 
&lt;listOfAttributeAssignments&gt;. Your definition for this example 
 (as below) is much better. 

	    &lt;listOfAttributeAssignments&gt;
	       &lt;attributeAssignment attribute="x" value="K div 3 + 1"/&gt;
		 &lt;attributeAssignment attribute="y" value="K mod 3 + 1"/&gt;
	    &lt;/listOfAttributeAssingments&gt;

Nevertheless, in the future we might need explicit attributes as well. Then
we should use your alternative scheme:
		&lt;listOfAttributeAssignments&gt;
			&lt;attributeAssignment id="1" attribute="x" value="3"/&gt;
			&lt;attributeAssignment id="1" attribute="y" value="2"/&gt;
			&lt;attributeAssignment id="2" attribute="x" value="2"/&gt;
			&lt;attributeAssignment id="2" attribute="y" value="1"/&gt;
			etc
		&lt;/listOfAttributeAssingments&gt;

Now, the harder issues:
4) Where to define connections?
Possibilities:
	a) Within compartments as I did.
        b) Within reactions as you did.
        c) Outside of all elements with reference.
The questions to ask are: 1)are connections needed only to represent the elements on 
which some rules or reactions operate? 2) Can same set of connections support more 
then one reaction and/or rule? The answer to first question is yes which suggest 
implementation b). But the answer to second question is, I think, NO. For example,
same set of connections can have a parameter rule defined on it and 
SpecieConcentration rule defined on it and some kinetic rule defined on it... This 
means that I would have to repeat the same connection description for each rule. Why 
do that? It is easier to define connections within elements that these connections 
connect as in a) and then in reactions just refer to connections.

5) What about functions?
I would try to avoid user-defined functions for as long as possible. SBML is model-
description language and not that much of a functional language. If we include user-
defined functions, we would have to write more complicated interpreters from SBML 
level2 to SBML level1. If we continue at this pace, pretty soon we will be writing 
full-blown compilers. Predefined or built-in functions are necessary and will help a 
lot, but I would not allow user-defined functions for now. By the way Bruce and/or Eric 
might disagree with me. Instead of calling a function, I would refer to connection 
name "ngb". By the way LAMBDA in this example is a connection strength which is indeed
0 when connection does not exist. But LAMBDA does not have to be 0 or 1 it will 
eventually be a formula of cell coordinates and cell size and probably should be a 
parameter Rule acting on connection "ngb". I think it is easier this way.
