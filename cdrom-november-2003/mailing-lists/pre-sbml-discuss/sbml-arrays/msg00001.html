FYI...
Victoria Gor and I had the following email exchange concerning arrays:
(I have attached documents mentioned in these messages)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;From Victoria

Following are my comments on "Possible extensions to the Systems
Biology Markup Language". Please, let me know what you think about them.
If some of them are valid, you or me can formulate Sbml structures that will
support them.

First few words about Model Expansion. I am a bit confused here, since from
the
moment we introduced model expansion and instances to SBML we turned
modeling
language (the language that explicitly enumerates biological model) to the
programming language (language that represents operations on data in concise
manner). So, SBML is not like XML any more. I suppose it is OK for SBML to
be
programming language, but then nobody should want to look at expanded form
of SBML
(just imagine expansion for 1000 compartments which are fully
connected ).Also, I
would not want my programs to have to read expanded forms of SBML. Such
would be
too verbose of the description even for computer program. I think it is the
job of
SBML parsers (or programs that read or use SBML models) to expand them. And
since
we are moving away from XML constraints, such parsers would have to be
custom-made.

1) The array representation described by you seems quite adequate to me.
We would want to add new component: "connection" that can occur in arrays
(it is
explained in 3)). In addition, since we need to implement a model where
compartments can crawl all over the three dimensional grid and have some
changing
geometric shape, each compartment must have x,y,z coordinate attributes and
some
shape descriptor (radius of a cylinder or sphere?).

3) The concepts of patterns, mappings, connectionDimensions and
Connection Groups describing neighborhoods seems to me a bit specific for a
biological programming language.  I would prefer to reformulate these
concepts a
bit. We DO need to represent neighborhoods of compartments or connections,
but it
seems that they need to be a bit more flexible for wider range of biological
problems (for example, neurons can be connected to other very far-situated
neurons
by synapses or some compartments can be connected to other compartments if
they are
within some distance measure from each other and not necessary the directly
adjacent neighbors).  We would need to have different groups of connections
representing different forms of neighborhoods. Presently, I can think of
three
different groups of connections: geometric, explicit and complete.

Geometric connections are the ones we specifically need for meristem model.
They are connections between two compartments. These connections do not need
to be
explicitly enumerated, geometric connections can simply have the formula (or
function)
attribute which acts on compartment coordinates: f(Xc, Yc, Zc, Xn, Yn, Zn),
where Xc,
Yc, Zc are coordinates of one compartment (let's say center compartment),
Xn, Yn, Zn
are coordinates of candidate neighbor compartment. The formula (or function)
itself
determines if two compartments are neighbors. For example, formula can be
Euclidean
distance with threshold. If two compartments are within threshold distance
from each
other, they are neighbors. Formula also can be different for different
ranges of
parameters Xc, Yc, Zc, Xn, Yn, Zn. This will take care of "simple_hexagon"
model
described by you. So, for geometric connections all we need to specify in
SBML is
the formulas for different parameter ranges (if there are different ranges).
This
sounds like Connection Groups defined by you, but your Connection Groups
represent
different concept (the concept of neighbors connected with different
patterns), which
we would not need any more, since we will define geometric connectivity with
formulas for
geometric parameter ranges. Such geometric connections should make the job
of SBML model
creators easier .

Complete connections are also easy to specify. These are connections which
are
present between EVERY two compartments (full connectivity) of specific type
or between all sub-compartments within same compartment or within
some sub-model. For complete connections all we have to specify is the
sub-model
and/or type of compartments and/or inclosing compartment that uses them.

Explicit connections are harder. They have to be actually enumerated by
modeler.
I suggest SBML should enumerate them similarly to Bruce Shapiro's cellerator
inputs.
This means that we have to specify each connection in the list. For example,
we would
have to say that compartment_I is connected to compartment_J with specific
attributes
(if such exist). Therefore, we would have to produce a list of pairs of
connected
compartments (explicit connections) with a list of attributes for each pair.
Such
attributes can be a number or a formula. I suppose this representation of
connections
will be useful for smaller, but more detailed sub-models.

In general, I have only described the proposed concise (not-expanded)
representations
for different groups of connections for use in SBML. How these connections
are
actually represented in memory is a decision to be made by parsers or other
programs
that read SBML.


4) We also propose different TYPES of connections for different interaction
formulas
and parameters. The idea is that every connection TYPE can be described
concisely
with formula and parameters. And type might be set in two ways: concisely ,
that is
once for entire group (neighborhood) of compartments or once for some
sub-model with
compartments or once for all sub-compartments within some compartment; and
explicitly
that is by individually naming the type of each connection. Once again, the
latter is
especially useful for smaller and more detailed sub-models.

My Reply:

points 1-4 I agree with.  The connection scheme I described is simply too
kludgy to use in practice: the form you describe "fixes" this.  We should
work out how to
represent the structures you describe.

I have attached a proposed form for describing geometry in level 2
developed by the VCell group.
I propose we work out a very minimal subset of this geometry proposal that
we need for
geometric connections.  This will minimize our dependency on the
geometric part of level 2 - IMHO this is advantageous.

Do we really need shape information?  If we just use compartment
co-ordinates and a threshold function then don't we have an implied
tessellation of cells?  Isn't that enough for the definition of connections?
Probably not in the long term!  But lets start simple.

I'd like to propose a scheme for organizing connections types and
attributes:

We simply group connections into sets.  Each set is defined by one or more
connection
definitions.  A connection definition is either explicit, function based or
complete
as you described.

A specific array of reactions is defined using a specific connection set
which specifies where
the reaction occurs.

I don't think its necessary to attach attributes to connection sets.  Arrays
of all classes of
objects need to be defined on connections.  For example if a connection
defines a membrane then
we need to be able define a either a sub model for it or minimally a single
reaction.

Expansion
---------

All XML parsers are custom made at some level: there is always some
component
that takes the outputs of an xml parser (events or objects) and generates
events or objects
that are appropriate for the application domain.  Expansion is just an
additional step
that may or may not be required depending on the capabilities of the
software using the
parser.

Expansion can be viewed as an internal transformation of parsed objects from
one form to another.
This expansion would occur entirely with a software component.  The
important point is
to ensure that the expanded form is always encodable in level 1. This
ensures that
systems that can only deal with level 1 objects can still process the result
of
the expansion process.

In practice I imagine that the SBW group will produce a software component
that will do expansion.  This component in normal use will not encode the
expanded form in xml.  Software that can only interpret level 1 objects
can then use this component to parse level 2 xml.

The description I sent you uses the expansion process as a way
to define the semantics of the array objects.  A parser of level 2 can map
the level 2 input to any structure it likes as long as that parser
combined with the rest of the system that includes it preserves the
semantics.  Perhaps we should find a better way to define the array
semantics?

There is no reason why the expanded form of level 2 can't be encoded in XML.
I agree this form will be verbose.

co-ordinates and a threshold function then don't we have an implied
tessellation of cells?  Isn't that enough for the definition of connections?

I think we need shape information, at least radius or, may be, heights. In
meristem problem cells can
and will overlap, they will also grow, and areas
of overlap are ESSENTIAL.


"points 1-4 I agree with.  The connection scheme I described is simply too
kludgey to use in practice: the form you describe "fixes" this.  We should
work out how to represent the structures you describe."

In accordance with proposed by you scheme, we would define connection sets
either inside &lt;listOfModels&gt; or inside &lt;listOfCompartments&gt; or inside
&lt;listOfSpecies&gt; or inside &lt;listOfInstances&gt;. The closest inclosing list
will be DOMAIN on which given connections will operate. Connection set will
then look like this:

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
   | CONNECTION_SET
   |------------------------------------------------------------------------
   | name: SName
   | type: TypeKind
   | mapping: BooleanFunction { used only when type = "function_based" }
   | connection: Connection[0..*]
   | reaction: Reaction[1..*]
   | rule: Rule[0..*]
   | model[0..*]: Model
   | domain: Reference[0..*] (??? used only if domain is NOT an
   |                          outside list of objects)
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------



where:
  name - string which is a name of the connection set.
  type - the kind of the connections inside the set;
         possible values: "explicit", "function_based" or "complete".

      ***"Complete" connections will indicate that there is a connection
         between each pair of objects in the DOMAIN.

      ***"Function_based" connections will indicate that there is a
connection
         between two objects in the domain iff mapping is true. That means
that
         mapping function f(X,Y,Z,Xc,Yc,Zc) must be specified and must be
         boolean and it also means that coordinates X,Y,Z of objects in
         inclosing list must be specified. It follows that  &lt;listOfModels&gt;,
         &lt;listOfCompartments&gt;,&lt;listOfSpecies&gt;, &lt;listOfInstances&gt; must have
an
         option to define coordinates within them. For example Compartment
         definition will look like this:
          ----------------------------------------------------------
         | COMPARTMENT
         |----------------------------------------------------------
         | name: SName
         | volume: double {use ="default" value = "1"}
         | radius: double {use = "optional"}
         | units: SName {use = "optional"}
         | outside: SName {use = "optional"}
         | x: double {use = "optional"}
         | y: double {use = "optional"}
         | z: double {use = "optional"}
          ----------------------------------------------------------

         Incorporating Bruce Shapiro's definition of functions,
         f(X,Y,Z,Xc,Yc,Zc) can look like following:

         &lt;listOfFunctions&gt;
              &lt;function name="f" condition="(X-Xc&lt;2) &amp;&amp; (Y-Yc&lt;2) &amp;&amp;
(Z-Zc&lt;2)"
                   &lt;listOfVariables&gt;
                        &lt;variable name="X" type="double"/&gt;
                        &lt;variable name="Y" type="double"/&gt;
                        &lt;variable name="Z" type="double"/&gt;
                        &lt;variable name="Xc" type="double"/&gt;
                        &lt;variable name="Yc" type="double"/&gt;
                        &lt;variable name="Zc" type="double"/&gt;
                   &lt;/listOfVariables&gt;
             &lt;/function&gt;
         &lt;/listOfFunctions&gt;

         This is an example of boolean function. It has only condition in
it.
         Later, I will give example where function is not boolean and
         represents reaction.

         Of course, this is an "unexpanded" definition of connections. The
         interpreting program would have to come up with explicit definition
of
         every connection (as will be shown next). To do that it would have
         to scan every pair of objects in inclosing list and if the function
on
         those objects is true, build explicit connection.

      ***"Explicit" connections are most important since they will be the
only
         one remained in expanded form. If the type of connections is
         "Explicit", connection elements in Connection_Set must be
specified.
         The type "Connection" will consist of two integers, one is the
index
         of the object from which connection is drawn, another one the index
         of the object to which connection is drawn. (Indexing is implicit.
It
         is kept by dimension of array, but we can make it explicit if
needed.)

  mapping - a boolean function that gets expanded into specific connections
(as
          was described for "Function-based type".

  connection - an explicit list of connections
          -----------------------
         |CONNECTION
         |-----------------------
         |from: integer
         |to : integer
          -----------------------

  reaction -,
  rule -,
  model - are the entities that are applied to elements of connected
objects.
  According to proposed by you scheme these entities must be defined inside
  connection_set block and operate only on connections in outside
  connection_set. At least one of these three entities must be specified for
  each connection_set. Also consider the possibility of putting
connection_sets
  any place in the SBML file. This is also possible. To do that all we would
  have to do is include DOMAIN as connection_set element (it is last in the
  first diagram). The Domain will specify to which list (array) of objects
  connections apply, and it is of type Reference (could be
CompartmentReference
  or SpecieReference and is a string that is a name of corresponding
  compartments or species). We can also assume that if the domain element is
  specified, reference is explicit, and if it is not specified, the domain
is
  a list of elements inside which connection_set is defined.

  And finally, all of this has one problem. In the reactions and other
  applications of formula, we might want to define different formulas for
  different parameter (or reactants) ranges. One easy way around this
problem
  is to add possibility for using function everywhere where formula is
currently
  used (in reactions or other applications). For example, the function
  representing reaction can look like following (this is derived from Bruces
  definition of functions):

  &lt;listOfFunctions&gt;
     &lt;function name="f" condition="(x&lt;0)"  formula="0.5*pow(-z+x/(x^2 + 9),
y)"
                        condition="(x&gt;=0)" formula="0.5*pow(-z+(x^2 + 9)/x,
y)"
                        condition="(z=0)"  formula="0.0" &gt;
        &lt;listOfVariables&gt;
            &lt;variable name="x" default="1" type="integer" /&gt;
            &lt;variable name="y" default=None type="real"/&gt;
            &lt;variable name="z" default="-1.5" type="real" /&gt;
        &lt;/listOfVariables&gt;
    &lt;/function&gt;
  &lt;/listOfFunctions&gt;



  If you agree with these constructs, I will generate an example
  (non-expanded) of SBML file that uses these constructs and will send it
  to you when you get back from Europe. (By the way, when would that be,
  got to set my deadlines.)

Victoria's Response:

"I think it would be useful if you could provide an example model
using your proposed scheme.  As it would help to clarify how it works.
(I'm back on 10th January)."

-I will have an example model by January 10th.

"I'm confused as why you need to have the reaction, rule and model
attributes
on the connection set element."

Consider the case where the reaction is occurring between the elements of
two separate
compartments. How would you represent it? Or what if same reaction is
occurring between
all pairs of 100 compartments. One reaction is then associated with 9900
connections, or
one concise CONNECTION_SET with one reaction. (Of course, I would not want
to look at
expanded version of it). Now, I suspect where reaction can occur, a rule can
occur
and even sub-model too. I might be wrong, but we are dealing with arrays
now, and it
is good generalization that the elements of everything that is an array can
be linked by
connection and any sort of action (reaction, rule_application or sub_model
generation)
that can happen between two or more simple objects can also happen between
two objects of
an array. How else would you represent developmental processes in a tissue
(meristem, for
example)? If you have any other ideas, please tell me.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

My Response:

I was thinking along the following lines when
I made the original definition.
I'm going to use a non xml notation to make things concise:

first to demo the notation here's a model that doesn't use arrays:

compartments: unit;
species:
s1 in unit;
s2 in unit;
reactions:
r1 : s1 -&gt; s2 : k1*s1;

////////////////////////////////////////////////////

now in a different model introduce arrays using a C style notation.

compartments:
a[0..9];

species:
s[i:0...9] in a[i];

connectiondefinitions:
f(i,j) { j == i + 1 }

reactions:
r[i:0...9][j:0...9 where f(i,j)] : s[i] -&gt; s[j] : k1 * s[i]

///////////////////////////////////////////////////
explaination: a connection is used to create a sparse dimension to an array.
Since you can have an array of anything you can have connections of
anything.
This means that connections are part of array definitions and don't
have to specifically reference objects on the connection.
This example creates a chain of species with a reaction connecting each
species in the chain.

In fact it means that you can have an array of entities on a connection.
eg
species:
ss[i:0...9][j:0..9 where f(i,j)][k:0...9];
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Victoria's response:

I will make the model using your C style notation if
it is OK with you.

My Response:

Fine by me.
