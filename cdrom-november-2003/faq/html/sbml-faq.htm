  This Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document answers questions about
  the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML).  It is a non-normative
  document that does not <I>define</I> any aspect of SBML; rather, it is
  intended to provide additional information about the language in an
  easily accessible and readable form.  Only the SBML specifications define
  SBML.  (See Section&nbsp;<A HREF="sbml-faq.htm#sec:docs">4</A> for information on where to find the
  specification documents.)

1 SBML Introduction and Background
</H1>

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00011000000000000000">
1.1 What is SBML?</A>
</H2>

<P>
The Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) is a machine-readable format for
describing qualitative and quantitative models of biochemical networks.  It
can also be used to express the interactions of biochemical networks with
other phenomena.  By a ``biochemical network'', we mean a system consisting
of biochemical entities linked by chemical reactions that alter, transport
and/or transform the entities.

<P>
The primary encoding of SBML is <A NAME="tex2html5"
  HREF="http://www.w3.org/XML/">XML</A>, a
popular text-based language for expressing structured data in a generic
fashion.  As a result, software developers can quickly write tools to
manipulate SBML by reusing existing XML software tools.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00012000000000000000">
1.2 What is the purpose of SBML?</A>
</H2>

<P>
SBML is designed to enable the exchange of biochemical network models
between different software packages.  The aim is to (1) enable the enable
the exchange of models between software tools with little or no human
intervention, thus allowing the tools to be properly integrated; and (2)
enable these models to be published in electronic form alongside, for
example, peer-reviewed journal articles.  The emphasis in SBML is on
supporting quantitative models.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00013000000000000000">
1.3 What can be represented in SBML?</A>
</H2>

<P>
An SBML model consists of a set of chemical entities linked by reactions
that can transform one entity into another or transport entities between
compartments.  A <I>compartment</I> in SBML is a location having a defined
size or extent (which may be in terms of volume, area, or length).  Every
chemical species in an SBML model must be located in a compartment.

<P>
SBML can represent not only biochemical networks, but also quantitative
models of interaction between these networks and other phenomena.  SBML can
also describe discrete events that are triggered by state changes in the
modeled system.  The scope of SBML is constantly evolving through a
community-led development.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00014000000000000000">
1.4 Is SBML a database schema?</A>
</H2>

<P>
Not specifically.  There is no reason why SBML models could not be stored
in a database, nor is there any reason why you could not use SBML as a
schema.  However, this was not the motivation for creating SBML.  An SBML
model is meant to encode a consistent view of knowledge of a biological
system.  SBML is not meant to encode a large set of potentially conflicting
knowledge about such a system.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00015000000000000000">
1.5 Who developed SBML?</A>
</H2>

<P>
SBML originated out of a workshop on software platforms for systems biology
held in the year 2000 with funding by the Japan Science and Technology
Corporation (JST).  The original authors were Michael Hucka, Andrew Finney,
Herbert Sauro and Hamid Bolouri, but SBML is now very much a community
effort.  Please see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="sbml-faq.htm#sec:history">8</A> for more details about the
history of SBML.  See Section&nbsp;<A HREF="sbml-faq.htm#sec:organization">7</A> about how you can
participate in SBML's evolution.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00016000000000000000">
1.6 Where is SBML defined?</A>
</H2>

<P>
The Systems Biology Markup Language is formally defined in specification
documents (see Question&nbsp;<A HREF="sbml-faq.htm#sec:spec-docs">4.2</A>).

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00017000000000000000">
1.7 Where is the SBML web site?</A>
</H2>

<P>
The home website for SBML is <TT><A NAME="tex2html6"

3 SBML Levels

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00031000000000000000">
3.1 What are SBML ``Levels''?</A>
</H2>

<P>
SBML is being developed in a series of <I>levels</I>, where each level adds
new features and fixes problems with the previous level.  The
lowest-numbered levels provide fundamental features that are common to all
biochemical network models.  Higher-numbered levels add more features that
are specific to particular classes of tools.  Any level can be used as a
standard for interchanging models.

3.2 What is the current SBML Level?</A>

<P>
The changes in SBML Level&nbsp;2 include: replacing SBML Level&nbsp;1's text-string

<A NAME="tex2html44"
  HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-MathML2-20030411/">MathML</A>

  HREF="http://www.cellml.org">CellML</A>, introducing support for named
function definitions, introducing explicit modifier species such as
catalysts in reactions, and introducing new constructs for discrete events

3.4 Why is Level&nbsp;1 still being kept around if Level&nbsp;2 has been defined?
</H2>

<P>
There exist tools that either were developed before the creation of SBML
Level&nbsp;2 or for which Level&nbsp;1 is more appropriate.  Thus, SBML Level&nbsp;1
continues to have relevance even with the existence of Level&nbsp;2.  

<P>
Note that since all Level&nbsp;1 models can be translated to SBML Level&nbsp;2, tools
that read SBML Level&nbsp;2 can be made to support Level&nbsp;1 reasonably easily.
Moreover, the availability of <SMALL>LIBSBML</SMALL> makes it much easier for
application developers to support different SBML levels in software
applications.  Among other features, <SMALL>LIBSBML</SMALL> has a built-in
Level&nbsp;1 to Level&nbsp;2 translation facility.  (See

3.5 What is the point of having a Level&nbsp;1 Version&nbsp;2?  Why not
  forget about it now that Level&nbsp;2 is out?</A>
</H2>

<P>
First, please refer to the previous question about why it is important to
have both Level&nbsp;1 and Level&nbsp;2 coexist.  As to the question of why bother
with a Version&nbsp;2 definition, there were many reasons why it became
necessary to introduce a Version&nbsp;2 of Level&nbsp;1.  Here is a sample of the
reasons:

<UL>
<LI>Some things needed to be clarified, like the fact that stoichiometric
  constants were supposed to be <I>positive</I> integers but the original
  Level&nbsp;1 Version&nbsp;1 specification never mentioned this.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>There were some inconsistencies in the original specification, such
  as whether the annotation attribute on SBase was supposd to be spelled
  <TT>annotation</TT> or <TT>annotations</TT>.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>People kept requesting the ability to make more things optional in
  models, such as compartments.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>People repeatedly complained about certain issues such as the
  spelling of ``species'' vs ``specie''.

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Level&nbsp;1 is meant to coexist with Level&nbsp;2, therefore it ought to be as good
as we can make it because people will (hopefully) be using it.  If people
complain about problems, and we have the ability to fix them, and the fixes
are basically isolated from people's code in parser libraries such as Ben
Bornstein's <SMALL>LIBSBML</SMALL>, why not make the fixes?

5 The Design of SBML</A>
</H1>

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00051000000000000000">
5.1 What is the basic idea behind the SBML units system?</A>
</H2>

<P>
The idea is that the units associated with every math entity in a model
should be precisely defined, while at the same time allowing for reasonable
default unit definitions.  The set of math entities important in this
regard includes variables, parameters and the result of equations.

<P>
The motivation for having a units system in SBML is threefold: it allows
the semantics of math entities to be defined precisely, it allows a
consistent method for handling multi-compartmental models, and in the
longer term, it will allow for consistency-checking and unit conversions in
models that are composed from submodels.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00052000000000000000">
5.2 Are the units used in a model not well-defined unless the model contains unit attribute values?</A>
</H2>

<P>
In a model that doesn't define values for unit attributes, only the units of
parameters (and their rules) are undefined.  The units of species,
compartments and kinetic laws are well-defined via built-in defaults.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00053000000000000000">
5.3 But isn't allowing default units a bit of cop-out?</A>
</H2>

<P>
The specification states that all math entities apart from parameters have
precisely defined units.  Unfortunately, the majority of software tools
today offer little or no support for units.  We could not have
interoperability between tools if we imposed a mandatory, explicit units
system.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00054000000000000000">
5.4 Not having a precise definition of parameter units is a big hole, isn't it?</A>
</H2>

<P>
In Level 1 and Level 2, the only practical use for these would be for documentation purposes.
We don't and can't expect software to determine and check the effective units of parameters by analyzing
equations.  In addition, many tools don't require units on parameters, so we allow parameter
units to be optional.

<P>
We anticipate that some systems supporting model composition in Level 3 will check parameter units.
However, it's still an
open question to many people whether tools should impose constraints
on parameter units and/or perform conversions between math entities
as part of the composition process.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00055000000000000000">
5.5 What are the `built-in' units exactly?</A>
</H2>

<P>
There are built-in units for substance, length, area, volume and time.  These units
are, by default, used to form the units of various math entities in a SBML model.
For example, by default, a species symbol in a kinetic law equation has substance/volume 
units (assuming that the species' compartment has 3 spatial dimensions).

<P>
These built-in units are in turn defaulted to specific units.  For example,
<I>substance</I> defaults to units of moles.  An SBML model can explicitly
set the underlying units of a built-in unit; for instance, it is possible
to redefine <I>substance</I> to be millimole.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00056000000000000000">
5.6 What are the benefits of the `built-in' units?</A>
</H2>

<P>
The great benefit of having built-in units is that it allows
a model to redefine the underlying units of a whole model
precisely without having to assign units to every math entity explicitly.

<P>
The SBML specification ensures that the built-in units operate in a consistent
and reasonable way across math entities.

<A NAME="sec:models-without-compartments"></A>
<BR>
5.7 How should models without compartments be encoded?
</H2>

<P>
The models should locate all species in a single compartment with unit volume.
The default units system of SBML will ensure that this unit volume
representation is exactly equivalent to a model dealing with concentrations,
including rate laws defined in substance/volume/time units.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00058000000000000000"></A>
<A NAME="sec:why-no-default-compartment"></A>
<BR>
5.8 Why doesn't SBML Level&nbsp;2 define a default compartment with unit volume?
</H2>

<P>
There are several reasons:

<OL>
<LI>A model that uses a single unit-volume compartment is making explicit
  an important underlying assumption about the model.  Leaving it implicit
  would be more prone to errors.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>A default compartment would be a special case which all SBML parsing
  programs would have to handle specially.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>We would have to invent a reserved name to refer to the default
  compartment.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>It would only save effort in developing the SBML writing component of
  a software tool.  The writing component is the easy part; reading and
  interpreting is the harder part.

<P>
</LI>
</OL>

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00059000000000000000">
5.9 Why does SBML include ``low-level'' features such as rules in
  combination with biochemical concepts like reactions and species?</A>
</H2> 

<P>
The aim of SBML is to enable the construction of quantitative models that
describe both the activity of biochemical networks and interaction of
biochemical networks and other phenomena.  SBML allows the declaration of
variables (non-constant parameters) and associated ODEs and DAEs to
describe these phenomena.  Examples of these phenomena include the
mechanical force generated by muscle cells and the electrical potential
across a synapse.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION000510000000000000000">
5.10 Why is there a distinction between assignment and algebraic rules?
  Aren't they equivalent?</A>
</H2>

<P>
Although it is typically easy to transform between assignment and algebraic
rules, we make the distinction in SBML because:

<UL>
<LI>Algebraic rules define the point in the model where there is a circular
  dependency between variables.  For instance, the equations <IMG
 WIDTH="51" HEIGHT="28" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="sbml-faq-img2.gif"
 ALT="$x = 2y$"> and <IMG
 WIDTH="70" HEIGHT="28" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="sbml-faq-img3.gif"
 ALT="$y = x + 1$">
  have a circular dependancy.  It is not possible to form such a dependancy in
  scalar rules (see the SBML Level&nbsp;2 specification).  At least one of the example
  equations would have to be encoded as an algebraic rule in SBML.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Many tools are not capable of supporting algebraic rules (DAEs)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Those tools that do support make the distinction between assignment rules
  and algebraic rules.

<H2><A NAME="SECTION000511000000000000000">
5.11 Why can't functions be recursive in Level 2?</A>
</H2>

<P>
Functions definitions in SBML Level 2 are designed to allow them to be
substituted in place of the function call operator; that is, they are
deliberately defined so that software tools can treat them like macros
rather than functions.  This would not be possible if functions were
allowed to be recursive.

response to state transitions in a model.

<P>

5.13 Is it possible to represent an entirely

5.14 What's the difference between the <TT>boundaryCondition</TT>
  and <TT>constant</TT> attributes on species in Level&nbsp;2?</A>
</H2>

<P>
Level 2 introduces the <TT>constant</TT> to the <TT>Species</TT> structure
in addition to the <TT>boundaryCondition</TT> from Level 1.  One might
expect these attributes to both define that the species doesn't vary during
simulation; however, there is a difference in their semantics.  The
<TT>constant</TT> attribute indicates that the species concentration
doesn't vary during simulation no matter what reactions or rules it occurs
in.  Such a constant species can't have an associated rule.  The
<TT>boundaryCondition</TT> attribute defines only that the species
concentration is not defined by the set of reactions.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION000515000000000000000">
5.15 Why were <TT>constant</TT> attributes introduced in SBML Level 2?</A>
</H2>

<P>
Given a model that doesn't contain algebraic rules it is possible to infer 
which components (species, compartment and parameters) are meant to be variables
by examining the set of scalar rules, rate rules and reactions.
However given a model
containing algebraic rules knowledge of which symbols are
variables and which are constants is required to solve the equations.
The occurence of a symbol in an algebraic rule doesn't imply that
the symbol is a variable.

5.16 Why isn't there an explicit definition of SBML in terms of an
  ODE equivalent form?</A>
</H2> 

<P>
On one hand, we were worried that a focus on the ODE representation would
deter developers that employ other forms, for example stochastic discrete
event simulation, from supporting SBML.

<P>
On the other hand, we simply have not had time to work on this area.  We
would welcome volunteers to work on this.  There is an example translation of
a model into ODEs in the specification for Level 2.

6.4 The unit system seems to imply some implicit unit conversions may be required in various places when parsing a model.
Can you give an overview of what you expect a model parser to do?</A>
</H2>

<P>
The first step is to establish what the units are of the various entities in your object model.
These units may be generic and thus can be derived from the SBML built-in units.

<P>
There are 3 places where unit conversion may have to occur depending on the units used for variables internal to a simulation:

<P>

<UL>
<LI><I>symbols in formulae</I>

Variables that are used in formulae may require a conversion from the object model units to the units associated with the SBML symbol
before the SBML formulae are applied to the variables.  

<P>
</LI>
<LI><I>result of formulae</I>

<P>
The result of SBML formulae may require a conversion from SBML units associated with the formulae result to the units associated
with the simulation variables that are assigned the result of formulae.  Particular attention should be placed on the
results of kinetic laws which have substance/time units in SBML.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><I>initial conditions</I>

6.5 My software cannot support all the features of SBML--what should I do?</A>
</H2>

<P>
Don't Panic.  Few if any packages support all aspects of SBML.  Depending
on what you wish do with a model you can either ignore features that are
not relevant to your tool or report errors when certain features are used.
In most cases a simulator will simply report an error if it encounters a
feature that it is unable to support.  Ignoring quantitative aspects of an
SBML model when parsing it into an simulator or analysis tool is strongly
discouraged, because it will make it unlikely a user will be able to
reproduce results seen in the tool which generated the model.

6.6 What do I do about the fact that SBML does not encode all the
  information that I need to encapsulate in a model?</A>
</H2>

<P>
You should use <TT>Annotation</TT> elements.  These are described in some detail in the Level&nbsp;1 and Level&nbsp;2
specification documents.  <TT>Annotation</TT> elements can be enclosed within any SBML element and can contain
elements of any namespace. Elements that are not in the SBML namespace should either locally redefine the default namespace
or use namespace prefixes to clearly separate application specific data from different software packages.
Data stored in annotation elements should not contain data that could be or is encoded in SBML.  

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00067000000000000000">
6.7 How should I structure annotations?</A>
</H2>

<P>
The annotation data enclosed in a specific SBML element is
assumed by other applications to be directly associated with that specific element.
Therefore it is important to decompose and locate annotation data appropriately in an SBML document.
Avoid, for example, encoding all annotation data in a top level attribute.
The data associated

Database identifier annotations can be created using CellML metadata in
SBML Level 2; see the

  HREF="http://www.cellml.com/public/metadata/cellml_metadata_specification.html">specification
  for CellML Metadata</A>, in particular Section&nbsp;4.10, ``Biological Entity''.
SBML elements derived from <TT>SBase</TT> have a <TT>metaid</TT> attribute,
which should contain a value unique to the SBML document.  RDF elements can
use this value as a reference to the specific element.

Its possible to use a simpler form of database identifier annotation than that shown
in the CellML specification.  For example here's an SBML species annotated with a GO term:

<P>
Whilst it is not expected that an application will detect all errors in an parsed SBML document it is
expected that a parser will not simply ignore or fudge discrepancies between the document and the relevant
SBML standard.  The parser should report the line number and a description of the error to the user
i.e. a parser should not assume that an incorrect SBML file is an extremely unusual event or that
the details of a parsing error are irrelevant to the user.

6.10 There are several different ways in which I could encode my

<P>
It is true that there are several ways in which to encode a given model in SBML, deciding which form to use in
various contexts is a big subject.  Although this section describes which SBML features are commonly used tools should
support as wide a set of features of SBML when reading SBML as possible.  Here is a rough guide:

<P>
Although <TT>id</TT> fields have restricted syntax do assume that tools could potentially display the contents
of this field to users even when <TT>name</TT> attributes are available.  This means that if you
capture names from a UI that this data is placed in both the <TT>name</TT> and <TT>id</TT> fields
(with the <TT>id</TT> field value perhaps slightly mangled).  Avoid using crude automatically generated values
in the <TT>id</TT> field.

6.11 How much effort should I invest in preserving the SBML form

<P>
The first priority should be to support as much of the SBML standard as possible both for reading and writing.
You should write using the most interoperable form as possible as described in Question&nbsp;<A HREF="sbml-faq.htm#sec:bestpractice">6.10</A>.
To maximize interoperability beyond this requires
trying to include as much of an imported SBML model as possible when rewriting it in SBML.  This includes preserving
annotation data and avoiding mangling <TT>id</TT> and <TT>name</TT> fields.  The order of structures, other than rules,
and the white space between elements do not require preservation.

SBML development has been and continues to be motivated and directed by the
systems biology community.  The process is managed by the <I>SBML

Working Groups and from other groups and individuals, and then seek to
establish a consensus in the community about how to proceed with the
proposals.  With this information, the editors assemble some of the
proposals into a draft specification for a new edition of SBML.  After this
draft has been reviewed by the community, it becomes a final specification
for the new edition of SBML.  (``Edition'' in this context can be either a
new SBML Level, or a new version of an existing level.)

Being a member of a working group implies a desire and
   willingness to work on actual software underlying the
   focus of the group's effort.  Proposals for SBML changes need
   to be accompanied by examples of one or more software
   implementations of the proposed changes.  To make this
   possible, the implementations should add proposed XML
   extensions within the SBML <TT>annotation</TT> element.  This
   will allow tools to exchange models with the proposed
   extensions in a semi-organized fashion.  Once the
   proposed changes have been debugged to the satisfaction
   of the group(s) using them, the proposal can be
   introduced to the SBML community at large.  When
   accepted, the new extensions will be migrated out of the
   'annotation' element and made a part of SBML.

7.9 What is the relationship between SBML and CellML?</A>
</H2>

<P>
CellML is built around an approach of composing systems of equations
by linking together the variables in those equations; this is augmented
by features for declaring biochemical reactions explicitly, as well as
encapsulating arbitrary components into modules.  By contrast, SBML
provides constructs that are
more similar to the internal object models used in many simulation/analysis
packages specialized for biochemical networks.  This reflects its history
of having been developed in cooperation with software developers who write
these tools.  In practice, SBML appears to be better suited to the purpose
of enabling interoperability with existing simulation tools focused on the
biochemical reaction level.  These differences notwithstanding, the SBML and
CellML efforts share much
in common, and the development of SBML has benefited from discussions and
interactions with the developers of CellML.  (The CellML
team has been an active participant in the SBML development process.)  The editors view CellML and
SBML as somewhat different approaches being investigated as solutions to the
same general problems.  One of the aims of the
<A NAME="tex2html66"
  HREF="http://www.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/zlocal/martins/sbml-comp/">model composition working group</A>
is to ensure that the two representations can be integrated with each other to create
a single standard in the future.  The result will be compositional compatibility
between CellML and SBML, such that models expressed in one language can be
used as components or submodels in the other.
