      <P><FONT color=#000000 face=Verdana size=2>JDesigner is a Win32 

      application which allows one to draw a biochemical network<BR>and export 

      the network in the form of SBML. The Designer has an SBW interface 

      that<BR>allows it to be called from other SBW compliant modules, for 

      example Python. In addition,<BR>JDesigner has the ability to use Jarnac as 

      a simulation server (via SBW) thus allowing<BR>models to be run from 

      within JDesigner. In this mode JDesigner is both a network design<BR>tool 

      and simulator. Full binaries and source code is available in the 

      download.</FONT></P>

      <P>YOU <b>MUST</b> USE THE LATEST JARNAC 2.0 for versions 1.8+. When you 

      install

      Jarnac make sure you <b>RE</b>-<b>REGISTER</b> Jarnac with SBW. Go to the 

      options menu and select register with SBW. Then QUIT and <b>RESTART</b> 

      SBW. To restart SBW, stop it first then restart it (see System Biology 

      Workbench menu in start menu).</P>

      <P><font size="2">Hill coefficients in the builtin rate laws were not 

      being prefixed with the<br>

      reaction name when written to the SBML file. This would cause problems for 

      models<br>

      with more than one hill equation which used the builtin hill equation.</font></P>

      <div>

        <font size="2">There was a missing notification message when users 

        deleted nodes and edges. Thus if a simulation had been carried out on a 

        model and the user deleted a node or edge, the simulation server would 

        not be notified and would continue using the original model instead of 

        the new model. This release fixes this issue. Thanks to a user for 

        spotting this problem.</font></div>

      <P><font size="2">1.8i<br>

      ----<br>

      <br>

      1. Version 1.8h inadvertently renamed reactions labels when a model was 

      loaded.</font></P>

      <P><font size="2">1.8h<br>

      ----<br>

      <br>

      1. Product alias nodes weren't working due to a rogue boolean expression.</font></P>

      <P><font size="2">2. Duplicate reactions names for non uni-uni reaction 

      sorted out as well.</font></P>

      <P><font size="2">3. Updated OpenXML library to 2.4</font></P>

      <P><font size="2">1.8g<br>

      <br>

      1. The root cause of duplicated reactions identified.<br>

      <br>

      <br>

      1.8f - never released<br>

      ----<br>

      <br>

      1. Range check error when node added with regulatory network display on<br>

      <br>

      2. Certain ways of adding reactions caused duplicate names to arise in the 

      reaction list.<br>

      <br>

      3. Multiple UniUni reactions do not overlay each other when drawn from the 

      same nodes<br>

      <br>

      4. Changing Species names now prompts user if associated rate laws should 

      also be changed.<br>

      <br>

      5. Small bug in drawing regulatory network while panning network image 

      (bug visible when<br>

      viewing Calvin cycle).<br>

      <br>

      6. In complex networks with conservation cycles where the stoichiometry 

      matrix can gets<br>

      rearranged, JDesigner was using the wrong information when instructing the 

      simulator from the<br>

      selection output list. Resulted in incorrect initialization, potentially 

      leading to<br>

      mass conservation violation. This bug became apparent when testing SBML 

      files from the SigPath site.<br>

      <br>

      7. Potential for access violation when closing down JDesigner has finally 

      been plugged!<br>

      Caused by a race condition between the SBW issuing notifications and 

      JDesigner closing<br>

      down. I hope there are no more of these, they look bad but they're fairly 

      harmless.<br>

      1. Reset button sometimes screwed up and reinitialised wrong nodes<br>

      <br>

      2. Pictogram option wasn't quite working correctly.<br>

      <br>

      3. Parameter scans and control coefficient selections didn't include 

      boundary conditions as one of the parameter types.<br>

      <br>

      4. Added multiselect to the selection box<br>

      <P><font size="2"><font color="#FF0000">You must</font> download Jarnac 

      2.0 &gt;#1 if you intend to use 1.8d as &gt;#1 has an enhanced<br>

      SBW interface which is required by this version.</font></P>

      <P><font size="2">1. Added Control coefficient and elasticity evaluation</font></P>

      <P><font size="2">2. Fixed a number of access violations and further 

      tidying up of the interface.</font></P>

      <P><font size="2">Version 1.8</font></P>

      <P>There are significant changes in this release.<br>

      <br>

      <font size="2">1. The node and edge property forms have been completely 

      reworked. These<br>

      forms (activated by right clicking over an edge or node and selecting<br>

      properties), are now dockable on either the left or right of the main<br>

      form. This allows users to select nodes and edges one after the other<br>

      and the property forms will update themselves to reflect the currently <br>

      selected object. In addition, to facilitate this, the keyboard short-cut,

      <br>

      ALT will cycle through node and edge objects. Each time a node or edge is<br>

      selected, it's properties may be edited. These changes makes it much 

      easier<br>

      to edit the details of models.<br>

      <br>

      2. The user interface edge property form has been partially redesigned. 

      The<br>

      most noticeable change is much better support for built-in rate laws. The 

      form<br>

      has two tabs, one for built-ins (default) and another for free format<br>

      rate laws. <br>

      <br>

      3. The time course simulation control panel has been enhanced so that 

      users<br>

      can

      select what variables should be passed to the plotter panel.<br>

      <br>

      4. The time course simulation control has also been enhanced to enable 

      simple<br>

      parameter scans to be carried out.<br>

      <br>

      5. A new analysis panel is supplied. This is a steady state analysis panel 

      which<br>

      not only computes the steady state but also gives an indication to the 

      state's<br>

      stability. Also includes a simple parameter scanning facility. No slider 

      control yet,<br>

      they will come in a later version.<br>

      <br>

      6. Jdesigner now fully supports the ability to simulate multiple models. 

      Users<br>

      can now, in a single session, maintain and analyse multiple models in 

      separate<br>

      windows. This facility requires the latest version of Jarnac (Full 2.0 

      release)<br>

      because it employs a new service API.<br>

      <br>

      7. A second output panel has been introduced, this is a simple text output

      <br>

      window, useful for just collecting raw numbers from simulations etc.<br>

      <br>

      8. You can now select what the simulator will return to JDesigner, by 

      default all<br>

      species concentrations are returned to JDesigner. However the 

      selection panel <br>

      permits a user to choose what they'd like returned, eg 

      species, fluxes and even <br>

      eigenvalues for steady state analysis. The selection choice will be 

      increased with<br>

      later versions</font></P>

      <P><font size="2">Version 1.70b</font></P>

      <P><FONT size=2>1. Multiple window support (MDI model). cut/copy and paste 

      between windows.<BR>2. Two new reactions, BiTri (A + B -&gt; C + D + F) 

      and TriTri (A + B + C -&gt; D + E + F).</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT size=2>From 1.7 to 1.7b (fixes and additions):</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT size=2>1. Added TriUni and UniTri to complete reaction set.<BR>2. 

      Text not positioned correctly when double clicked and scroll bars 

      moved<BR>3. Changes to edge detection algorithm resulted in very small 

      errors in edge detection for destination arcs. <BR>4. Some multi-arcs not 

      correctly imported, introduced when new arc types were 

      introduced.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT face=Verdana size=2><B>Latest update: 1.65b</B> - Lots of 

      changes<BR><BR>Bug fixes including:<BR><BR>1. Moving reaction arcs with 

      control key was not working correctly<BR>2. Text scaling on text objects 

      not correct because text objects<BR>in correctly used non-true type 

      fonts.<BR>3. Save to metafile brings up save dialog box<BR>4. Previous 

      versions were not saving the background colour to the SBML<BR>5. Print 

      Preview was not quite matching actual print out, now it does<BR>6. 

      Printing of text objects was not working<BR><BR></FONT><FONT 

      size=2>Printing from JDesigner</FONT><FONT face=Verdana size=2> now works 

      well. If you have Acrobat you can install the PDF<BR>printer driver, this 

      will allow you to generate PDF files of the pathway images, very 

      handy<BR>for publication etc.<BR><BR>New features:<BR><BR>1. Selection box 

      added, drag with mouse while holding mouse left mouse<BR>button to select 

      a group of nodes and reactions.<BR>2. Add notes to model, species, 

      reactions and compartments<BR>3. Allow use of keyboard cursor keys to move 

      selected objects.<BR>4. An initial release of functionality to support 

      cut/copy/paste<BR>5. Export Scamp scripts<BR>6. Added popup menu on the 

      drawing canvas to set colours and add models notes<BR>7. Notes many now be 

      added to individual nodes and reaction arcs<BR>8. The beginnings of a 

      MSHTML help file<BR>9. Displaying regulatory networks has been improved, 

      see BorisEJ.xml for example<BR>(see screenshot below).</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Latest update: 1.62a<FONT color=#ff0000> 

      </FONT>- Printing was not working correctly, now fixed, a very 

      rudimentary<BR>print preview added. A couple of issues with magnification 

      of images fixed which also<BR>caused problems with printing. Support for 

      loading the old binary network files has now<BR>been completely removed. 

      If you still need to load these binary files then use version<BR>1.61g. If 

      you need to load them into later versions save them as xml files. Fill 

      colors can<BR>now be specified for nodes if they have a border (see node 

      properties dialog box). Still<BR>problems with printing if pictograms are 

      used in the diagrams, trying to fix this one, might<BR>be a bug in the 

      printer driver. File Drag now uses sbml files rather than the dat files 

      (drag<BR>an sbml file on to the jdesigner canvas and it will load 

      it).</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Sample Models:</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT size=2>Here are some JDesigner compatible models (These are SBML

      <A href="http://www.cds.caltech.edu/~hsauro/Jarnac.htm">Jarnac</A>. In 

      addition Jarnac must be registered with SBW. To use Metatool with 

      JDesigner you must download the <A 

      href="http://www.cds.caltech.edu/~hsauro/sbw.htm">SBW metatool 

      interface</A> components.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT color=#000000 face=Arial size=2>Latest update: 5 Sept, v1.61, 

      lots of changes:</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT color=#000000 face=Arial size=2>1. Multiselect nodes, reactions 

      and other objects.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT color=#000000 face=Arial size=2>Latest update: 26 August, v1.6. 

      Read and write models in native SBML. Better support for simulation via 

      SBW.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT face=Arial><FONT size=2>Latest update: 14 July, v1.51b, added 

      experimental support for saving and loading of models using SBML. Also 

      added experimental simulation interface which uses&nbsp;SBW to access the 

      simulation services provided by Jarnac 2.0. If you&nbsp; want Jarnac 2.0 

      is automatically start when you request computational 

      capability,&nbsp;make sure you register it first (see options menu in 

      Jarnac 2.0) otherwise you'll have to start it by hand, in server mode if 

      desired. To request computational capability, select the menu options and 

      choose 'connect to simulator', if this was successful the run toolbar 

      button will become enabled. Click this button to bring up the simulation 

      gui</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT color=#000000 face=Arial size=2>Latest update: 20 June, v1.4e, 

      fixed a problem with parameter value assignment</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT color=#000000 face=Arial size=2>Latest update: 26 May 

      2002&nbsp;(Latest version 1.4b adds compartmentation). Version 1.4 had 

      problems if SBW wasn't installed on your machine, 1.4b has fixed 

      this&nbsp;unnecessary dependency.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT color=#000000 face=Arial size=2>New version 1.4c, fixes a few 

      annoying problems. Now has a save as toolbar button, screens rate laws 

      more carefully, setting arc thickness now works!<BR>
