		<h1>Return Value</h1>
		 <p>
		 
		 The return value of <span class="function">
		 SBMLRead</span> is a Mathematica rule list of the following form:
		 </p>
		 
		<pre  class="function">
	{
	SBMLODES -> <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:arial,verdana,helvetica,san-serif;color:black;">list of differential equations</span>,
	SBMLParameters -> <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:arial,verdana,helvetica,san-serif;color:black;">list of parameter rules</span>,
	SBMLIC -> <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:arial,verdana,helvetica,san-serif;color:black;">list of initial conditions</span>,
	SBMLSpecies -> <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:arial,verdana,helvetica,san-serif;color:black;">list of variables</span>,
	SBMLAlgebraicRules -> <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:arial,verdana,helvetica,san-serif;color:black;">list of algebraic rules</span>,
	SBMLUnitDefinitions -> <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:arial,verdana,helvetica,san-serif;color:black;">list of unit definitions</span>,
	SBMLUnitAssociations -> <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:arial,verdana,helvetica,san-serif;color:black;">list of unit associations</span>,
	SBMLReactions -> <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:arial,verdana,helvetica,san-serif;color:black;">list of reactions</span>,
	SBMLFunctions -> <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:arial,verdana,helvetica,san-serif;color:black;">list of pure function defintions</span>,
	SBMLNameIDAssociations -> <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:arial,verdana,helvetica,san-serif;color:black;">list of id/name associations</span>,
	SBMLEvents -> <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:arial,verdana,helvetica,san-serif;color:black;">list of events</span>,

	}
		</pre>
		
		
		<p>
		By default, all of this information is returned.  If a model does not have a particular feature, for example, if
		it does nto have any functions, then the corresponding field is returned as a null list, e.g., as
		<span class="function"> SBMLEvents->{}</span>.
		
		 However, the user is allowed to 
		inhibit return of  any portions of this information by using the return option to <span class="function">SBMLRead</span>. Several of the
		fields (<span class="function">SBMLFunctions</span>, <span class="function">SBMLNameIDAssociations</span>, <span class="function">SBMLEvents</span>) are only returned in SBML Level 2. 
		
		</p>
			
		<p>
		These return files are perhaps best illustrated with an example. Suppose that the file <a href="mathsbml-enzyme.xml">enzyme.xml</a> contains the
		following model:</p>
		<p>
		<img border="1" src="mathsbml-images/enzymedotxml.gif" />
		</p>
		<p>
		Then a mathematica session will look like this:
		</p>
		<p>
		<img border="1" src="mathsbml-images/enzymedotxml-sbmlread.gif" />
		</p>
		
		<p>
		
		Some of the fields such as <span class="function">SBMLAlgebraicRules</span> point to empty lists because there are
		no such objects in this model; ot her fields are absent, such as <span class="function">SBMLEvents</span>, because this
		model is expressed in SBML Level 1, which does not have events. For an explanation of the funny identifier names, namely the 
		addition of strings like <span class="function">EnzymeKinetics`</span> to the front 
		of each identifier, see the web page on <a href="mathsbml-contexts.html">contexts in MathSBML</a>.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		The <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:san-serif;color:red;">list of variables</span> has the form
		<pre class="function">
	{var1[t], var2[2],...}</pre>
		where each of &nbsp;<span class="function">var1, var2, ...</span>
		are variables that are governed by rate laws in the SBML models; i.e., any species, parameter, or compartment that is 
		described by a rate law in a rule, and species that are either products or reactants in reactions, 
		and are not boundary conditions. Each species in the SBML model is translated into a time-dependent function in the 
		Mathematica model. In level 2, the <span class="function">"id"</span> field is used to identify the variable. In level 1, the <span class="function">"name"</span> field is used.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		The global variable (i.e., in the Mathematica context &nbsp;<span class="function">Global`</span>)  
		&nbsp;<span class="function">t</span>
		 is reserved for time. It is anticipated that in future releases of 
		 MathSBML the name and context of the time variable can be reassigned at the user's direction.  In contrast to the 
		 SBML specification, &nbsp;<span class="function">SBMLRead</span>
		 does not yet make use of the csymbol for time; this will also be corrected in future versions. 

		</p>
		
		<p>
		The
		<span style="font-style:italic;font-family:san-serif;color:red;">list of differential equations</span>
		has the form
		<pre class="function">
	{var1'[t] == expression1, var2'[t] == expression2, ... }</pre>
		where each of 
		<span class="function">
		expression1, expression2, ... 
		</span>
		are Mathematica expressions formed by applying all of the rules and reactions that affect that corresponding species.  
		In level 2, the <span class="function">"id"</span> field is used to identify all variables and constants in the expression. In level 1, the <span class="function">"name"</span> field is used.
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
		The 
		<span style="font-style:italic;font-family:san-serif;color:red;">list of parameter rules
		</span>has the form
		<pre class="function">
	{par1 -> expression1, par2 -> expression2, ... }</pre>	
		where each of 
		<span class="function">par2, par2, ...</span>, 
		are constant parameters or variable parameters described by scalar type <span class="function">ParameterRules</span>; 
		compartments with volumes that 
		are either fixed or described by scalar type <span class="function">CompartmentVolumeRules</span>;
		species that are described by scalar type 
		<span class="function">SpeciesConcentrationRules</span>; 
		or species that are boundary condtions. 
		Each of  <span class="function">
		expression1, expression2, ... 
		</span> are either constants (for fixed values) or algebraic expressions that give the value of the parameter. 
		It is possible for the same parameter to be listed more than once in this list if the same local parameter name 
		is used in multiple reactions. 
		The parameters are listed in the same order in which they are defined in the SBML model. In level 2, the 
		<span class="function">"id"</span> field is used to identify the 
		parameter. In level 1, the <span class="function">"name"</span> field is used.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		The
 		<span style="font-style:italic;font-family:san-serif;color:red;">list of initial conditions</span>
 		has the form
		<pre class="function">
	{var1[0] == value1, var2[0] == value2, ... }</pre>
		where each of <span class="function">
		var1, var2, ...</span>, are the same as defined in list of variables above, and each of the
		<span class="function">value1, value2,...</span> are 
		the numeric values of the corresponding variables at time t=0.
		The lengths of the lists of initial conditions, variables, and differential equations are all the same. As usual, In level 2, the <span class="function">"id"</span> field is used to identify the variable. In level 1, the <span class="function">"name"</span> field is used.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		The <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:san-serif;color:red;">list of algebraic rules</span> has the form
		<pre class="function">
	{expression1==0, expression2==0, ... }</pre>
		where each of <span class="function">expression1, expression2, ...</span>
		are Mathematica expressions formed from the corresponding <span class="function">algebraicRule</span> in the SBML file.  In level 2, the <span class="function">"id"</span> field is used to identify all variables. In level 1, the <span class="function">"name"</span> field is used.
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
		The <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:san-serif;color:red;">list of reactions</span> has the form
		<pre class="function">
	{reaction1, reaction2, ...}</pre>
		where each of <span class="function">
		reaction1, reaction2, ...</span>
		 are representations of the corresponding reaction in the SBML model. Reactions are expressed in the form
		<pre class="function">
	n1*r1 + n2*r2 + ... -> m1*p1 + m2*p2 + m3*p3</pre>
		where each of the <span class="function">r1, r2, ...</span>
		and  <span class="function">p1, p2, ...</span> are the 
		reactants and products, and each of the 
		 <span class="function">n1, n2, ...</span> and 
		  <span class="function">m1, m2, ...</span> are their
		  corresponding stoichiometries.
		</p>
		<p>
		In SBML level 1, if any product or reactant occurs more than once in a single reaction, 
		the composite stoichiometry is given by the sum of (sk/dk) where sk and dk are the values of the stoichiometry and 
		denominator field of the kth occurance of the corresponding reactanct or product in the reaction.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		The  <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:san-serif;color:red;">list of pure function definitions</span> (level 2 only) has the form
		<pre class="function">
	{id1->Function[{arglist1}, definition1], 
	 id2->Function[arglist2, definition2], ...}</pre>
		where each of 
		<span class="function">id1, id2, ...</span> are the values of the function 
		<span class="function">"id"</span> fields specified in the SBML function
		defintion, each of the 
		<span class="function">arglist1, arglist2, ...</span>, 
		are the arguments of the corresponding function as dummy variables, and each of the 
		<span class="function">definition1, definiton2 ...</span>, 
		are expressions that evaluate to the value of the corresponding function in terms of the dummy variables. 
		
		represents a standard 
		Mathematica technique for defining a function. 
		</p>
		<p>
		To illustrate a pure function definition in Matheamtica, suppose the SBML (level 2) file which encodes a model by 
		the name of Example, has  the following implementation for a function foo(x)=1/(1+x^2).
		</p>
		<p>
		<img src="mathsbml-images/foo.gif" border="1" />
		</p>
		<p>
		Then the value returned by SBMLRead will include 
		<pre class="function">
	SBMLFunctions->{Example`foo->Function[{x},1/(x^2 + 1)], ... } </pre>
		To evaluate a function such as <span class="function">
		Function[{x},1/(x^2 + 1)]</span>, say to find the value of foo(y+z), one would enter the expression
		<span class="function">Function[{x},1/(x^2 + 1)][y+z]</span>,
		 to which Mathematica would return the expression <span class="function">(1+(y+z)^2)^-1</span>.
		Alternatively, one could define a function with the expression
		<pre class="function">
	foo[u_]:=Function[{x},1/(x^2 + 1)][u]</pre>
		and then type <span class="function">foo[y+z]</span> to obtain the same result.	
		 More detail on pure functions is given The Mathematica Book [5th Edition, S. Wolfram, Cambridge University Press/Wolfram Media, 2003].
		 </p>
		
		<p>
		The <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:san-serif;color:red;">list of name/id associations</span> (level 2 only) is a 
		list of the form <span class="function">
		{id1->name1, id2->name2,....}</span> describing the relationship between the
		<span class="function">"id"</span> and 
		<span class="function">"name"</span> 
		fields for every object in the model for which a <span class="function">"name"</span> is given.
		</p>
		
		<p>The <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:san-serif;color:red;">list of events</span> (level 2 only) describes the events in the SBML file in the following form,
		<pre class="function">
	{event1->{"trigger"->trigger expression, 
	          "delay"->delay expression, 
	          "events"->{id1->expression1, 
	                     id2->expression2, ...}, event2->{...}, 
		...}</pre>		
		where each of <span class="function">event1, event2, ...</span>
		are the event identifiers (values of the <span class="function">"id"</span> fields),
		<span class="function">trigger expression</span> is  is the event trigger formatted as a Mathematica logical expression whose value will be 
		<span class="function">True</span> if and only if the trigger condition is met;
		<span class="function">delay expression</span> is a Mathematica algebraic expression giving the required time delay; and each of 
		<span class="function">expression1, expression2,...</span> are algebraic
		expressions that give the values to which each of
		<span class="function">id1, id2, ...</span> are to be set should
		the event be triggered.
		</p>

		<p>
		The  <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:san-serif;color:red;">numerical solution</span>
		 is returned only if the option  <span class="function">SBMLNumericalSolution</span> is set to a positive value within the
		option  <span class="function">return</span>. The standard way
		to obtain a numerical solution is to first read the file with
		<span class="function">SBMLRead</span> and then solve the 
		 model with either <span class="function">SBMLNDSolve</span> or
		<span class="function">NDSolve</span>, as in
		<pre class="function">
	m = SBMLRead["myfile.xml",...];
	n = SBMLNDSolve[m,200];</pre>
		This will return a list of interpolating functions for 200 time units,
		<pre class="function">
	{{foo`var1->InterpolatingFunction[{0, 200},&lt;&gt;][t],
	  foo`var2->InterpolatingFunction[{0, 200},&lt;&gt;][t],...}</pre>
	  	Alternatively, if the call to SBMLRead has the form
	  	<pre class="function">
	m=SBMLRead["myfile.xml", return->{SBMLNumericalSolution->200,...},...]</pre>  	
	  	then the same interpolating functions will be returned as the numerical solution. 
	  	</p>
	  	<p>
	  	To use <span class="function">NDSolve</span> instead of <span class="function">SBMLNDSolve</span>, one would enter
<pre class="function">	NDSolve[Join[SBMLODES /. m, 
	             SBMLIC /. m, 
	             SBMLAlgebraicRules/.m], 
	        SBMLSpecies /. m, 
	        {t, 0, 100}]</pre>
	  	Note that the solution of Differential-Algebraic systems (DAEs) requires Mathematica version 5.0 or higher.
	  	If you have an earlier version, you may not include the algebraic rules. 
	  	</p>
	  	<p>
	  	</p>
	  	<p>
	  	The user can then subsequently call 
	  	 <span class="function">SBMLPlot</span>
	  	  or  <span class="function">Plot</span> manually, 
	  	  or can automatically invoke  <span class="function">SBMLPlot</span> if 
	 the call to  <span class="function">SBMLRead</span> sets any value except for   <span class="function">False</span> to the option   <span class="function">PlotOptions</span>.
