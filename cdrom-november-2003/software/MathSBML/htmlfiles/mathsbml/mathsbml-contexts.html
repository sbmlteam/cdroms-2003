			<span  class="function">
			SBMLRead</span> will attempt to match all identifiers in the Mathematica version of the model as closely as possible to the name in the model.
			Identifiers typically will be the values of <span  class="function">>
			"name"</span> fields in SBML Level 1 files and the values of <span  class="function">>
			"id"</span> fields in SBML Level 2 files.
			</p>

			<h2>SBML Characters Not Allowed in Mathematica Identifiers</h2>
			<p>
			The only character that is allowed in an SBML identifier is the underscore (<span class="function">"_"</span>) character.
			<span class="function">SBMLRead</span> will replace the underscore character with the <span class="function">\[UnderBracket]</span> character 
			(which looks like <img src="mathsbml-images/UnderBracket.gif" border="0" />).  For example, if the model contains a variable <span class="function">A_B</span> it will
			be represented in Mathematica as the variable 
			<img src="mathsbml-images/a_b.gif" height="9px" border="0" align="bottom" />.
			</p>

			<p>
			To use a different character, the user may set the value of the option <span class="function">underscore</span> to any other valid character in Mathematica.
			</p>

			<h2>Mathematica Representation of Invalid Characters</h2>
	
			<p>
			<span class="function">SBMLRead</span> accepts identifiers that contain any unicode character. This is an extension beyond the standard SId Type in SBML.
			Since many unicode characters are not permitted in Mathematica, invalid characters are replaced with the character string  
			<span class="function" style="font-style:italic;">#n#</span>, where <span class="function" style="font-style:italic;">n</span> 
			is the  decimal unicode representation of the character, and <span  class="function" style="font-style:italic;">#</span> is the Mathematica 
			<span class="function">\[NumberSign]</span> character (unicode 63268), which is different from the Shift-3 (cross-hatch, &#035;, or ASCII 35) character common on American keyboards.  The number sign character is considered a "letter-like" form by Mathematica, and any letter-like form may be included in an identifier.
			</p>

			<p>For example, a user may specify a variable identifier as <span class="function">Hello[World]</span>, with embedded brackets. 
			Brackets may not be embedded in a Mathematica identifier, and the variable will be represented as <span class="function">Hello<span style="font-style:italic;">#</span>91<span style="font-style:italic;">#</span>World<span style="font-style:italic;">#</span>93<span style="font-style:italic;">#</span></span> by <span class="function">SBMLRead</span>.
		</p>

		<h2>Variable Scoping (Contexts)</h2>


		<p>SBML model variables are defined in a local context; the name of the context is determined by the  model <span class="function">"name"</span> in SBML Level 1,  and by the model <span class="function">"id"</span> in SBML Level 2.
		</p>

		<p>
 		Thus if the SBML model <span class="function">foo</span> contains species <span class="function">A</span> and <span class="function">B</span>, and global parameters <span class="function">f</span> and <span class="function">k</span>, they will be represented as <span class="function">foo`A</span>, <span class="function">foo`B</span>, <span class="function">foo`f</span>, and <span class="function">foo`k</span>, respectively.  Local parameters <span class="function">k</span> and <span class="function">kf</span> defined in reactions <span class="function">R1</span> and <span class="function">R2</span> will become <span class="function">foo`R1`k</span>, <span class="function">foo`R1`kf</span>, <span class="function">foo`R2`k</span>, and <span class="function">foo`R2`kf</span>, respectively. 
		</p>


		<p>
		Mathematica represents the scope of a symbol by its context. The context of a variable is indicated by predicating it with a string of characters ending in the back-quote character (normally
		found to the lefet of the number 1 on American keyboards).  For example, <span class="function">foo`fred</span> and <span class="function">fooo`fred</span> represent two different variables in two different contexts, <span class="function">foo`</span> and <span class="function">fooo`</span>
		</p>

		<p>
		Mathematica contains a number of standard contexts. In particular, any variables that you type in during a  Mathematica session that do not explicitly include a context are placed in the <span class="function">Global`</span> context. You  do not have to explicitly include the context in <span class="function">Global`</span> variables. Thus the identifiers <span class="function">Barney</span> and <span class="function">Global`Barney</span> represent the same variable. You can change the default context form <span class="function">Global`</span> to something else  by changing the value of the Mathematica identifier <span class="function">$Context</span>.
		</p>

		<p>
		Mathematica also provides a global variable <span class="function">$ContextPath</span>
	 (its default value is <span class="function">{Global`, System`}</span>
  	that gives a list of contexts to search, after <span class="function">$Context</span>, 
  	in trying to find the definintion of a symbol. Standard functions like <span class="function">List</span> or 
  	<span class="function">Plus</span> are defined in the <span class="function">System`</span>
  	context. You do not have to explicitly state the name of the context for any variables in contexts listed in <span class="function">$ContextPath</span>.
  	When you load a new package, a new context is added to <span class="function">$ContextPath</span>. For example, when you
	  load <span class="function">MathSBML</span>, then <span class="function">$ContextPath</span>
  	 becomes <span class="function">{Global`, System`, MathSBML`}</span>. The function <span class="function">SBMLRead</span>
  	 is really <span class="function">MathSBML`SBMLRead</span> but you can omit the <span class="function">MathSBML`</span>
 	  because it is included in <span class="function">$Context$Path</span>.

		<h1>Example</h1>

		<p>Suppose we have encoded a model in the file <a href="mathsbml-enzyme.xml">enzyme.xml</a>,
		</p>

		<p><img src="mathsbml-images/enzymedotxml.gif" border="1" /></p> 

		<p>If we call SBMLRead without any options, the following information will be returned:</p>

		<p><img src="mathsbml-images/enzymedotxml-sbmlread.gif" border="1" /></p>

		<p>Because the model name is <span class="function">EnyzmeKinetics</span>, all symbols are prefaced with their context <span class="function">EnzymeKinetics`</span>.
		Additionally, the parameter <span class="function">k</span> in reaction <span class="function">Reaction2</span> does not have a value assigned to it, so that in the 
		list of differential equations, rather than being evaluated, it is specified as <span class="function">EnzymeKinetics`Reaction2`k</span>.  All units are placed in their own context, 
		specified in general as <span  class="function">model-identifier`Units`</span>; in this case, the units are in the context 
		<span class="function">EnzymeKinetics`Units</span>.
		</p>

		<p>	
		It is also worth observing at this point that this model contains a species by the name of <span class="function">E</span>. Normally in Mathematica, the sybmol <span class="function">E</span> would evaluate to the real number 2.71828...; by putting the variable within the model's context, this conflict does not occur.
		</p>

		<p>Having the word <span class="function">EnzymeKinetics</span> pop up everywhere makes the model seem a bit wordy.  The following will shorten it to a simple <span class="function">EK</span>:
		</p>
		
		<p><img src="mathsbml-images/contextexample.gif" border="1" />
		</p>
		
		<p>If we really want the variables to all be in the global context, we could instead use the option <span class="function">context->None</span>. However, this can cause conflicts if we are not very careful. For example, now that the variable <span class="function">E</span> is placed in the global context, it is replaced with the irrational number e. Disastarous results would occur if we tried to solve this model.
		</p>

		<p><img src="mathsbml-images/e.gif" border="1" />
		</p>
		
		<p>The basic rule to learn from this example is this: never override the context unless you are absolutely sure that no conflicts will occur.
