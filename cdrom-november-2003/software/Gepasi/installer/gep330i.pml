        <Char_Desc_250 />
        <Char_Desc_450>Gepasi simulates the kinetics of biochemical reactions and provides a number of tools to fit models to data, optimize model functions, performs metabolic control analysis and stability analysis. Gepasi allows the user to define models in the language of chemistry (reactions) instead of mathematics (matrices and differential equations). But the software uses a set of sophisticated numerical algorithms for fast and accurate results.</Char_Desc_450>
        <Char_Desc_2000>Gepasi is a software package for modeling biochemical systems. It simulates the kinetics of systems of biochemical reactions and provides a number of tools to fit models to data, optimize any function of the model, performs metabolic control analysis and linear stability analysis.
Gepasi simplifies the task of model building by assisting the user in translating the language of chemistry (reactions) to mathematics (matrices and differential equations) in a transparent way. This is combined with a set of sophisticated numerical algorithms that assure the results are obtained fast and accurate.Gepasi is intended primarily for research purposes but because of its user-friendly interface it is equally good for eduction.
