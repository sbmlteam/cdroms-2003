---------------
1.  Quick Start
---------------

If the computer has "Autorun" enabled, the system should automatically open
the index file upon loading the CD-ROM.  If this does not happen, please
open the CD-ROM folder/directory manually and open the file "index.html".

------------
2.  Contents
------------

This CD-ROM contains a collection of documents, software and other files on
the topic of the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML).  SBML is a model
definition language for representing biochemical reaction networks in a
machine-readable format. It is based upon XML, which in turn is a simple
and portable text-based medium that is widely used in computational biology
and bioinformatics.

You will find the following folders on this CD-ROM:

  specifications  -- The definitions of SBML, organized by levels and versions
  schemas	  -- XML Schemas corresponding to the levels & versions of SBML
  faq		  -- Frequently Asked Questions (and answers!)
  sample-models	  -- SBML files containing sample models
  software	  -- Numerous software packages featuring SBML support
  mailing-lists	  -- Archives of sbml-discuss@caltech.edu and other lists
  other-documents -- Miscellaneous other related documents

SBML is an evolving language and this CD-ROM will quickly fall out of date,
so please visit the project website, http://www.sbml.org, for the latest
information about SBML.
