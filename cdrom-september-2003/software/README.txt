This folder contains a number of software packages having the ability to
read and write models in SBML format.  Many of these packages were
developed and maintained by third parties, not the ERATO Kitano Symbiotic
Systems project.  Please see the individual software folders for more
information about their authors, terms of distribution, instructions for
use, and other information.

This collection of software is only a small fraction of the software
packages known to support SBML today.  At the time of this writing, over 30
software packages can read and/or write SBML, and more are being developed.
Please visit the project website, http://www.sbml.org, for a more complete
list.
