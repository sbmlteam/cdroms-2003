		<P><FONT face=Arial><STRONG>Jarnac: An Interactive Metabolic Systems 

Language</STRONG></FONT></P>

		<P><STRONG><FONT face=Arial>What is Jarnac ?</FONT></STRONG></P>

<P><FONT face=Arial><SMALL>Jarnac is a language for describing and manipulating 

cellular system models and can be used to describe metabolic, signal 

transduction and gene networks, or in fact any physical system which can be 

described in terms of a network and associated flows. Jarnac is basically 

version 2 of SCAMP.</SMALL></FONT></P>

		<P><FONT face=Arial><SMALL>Jarnac is a project I've been toying with for some 

years now and I finally took the plunge to write it after a stimulating trip to 

a recent NATO conference in April 1999. The current version is still being 

enhanced, this version and all future versions are being released into the 

public domain free of charge. However, the author still retains copyright and no 

commercial exploitation may be permitted without 

</SMALL><SMALL>acknowledging</SMALL><SMALL> the author.<BR><BR>I wrote Jarnac 

with a specific application in mind and this is still the main focus for 

continuing its development. I do not wish to suggest that Jarnac is in any way a 

formal standard for specifying metabolic systems or might even be useful to any 

other person other than myself, however if others do find it useful then all the 

better. Jarnac is a Windows based program that can run under 95/98, NT and 2000. 

Documentation is still being written but the latest release has more 

documentation and more examples that the previous release. There are over 100 

working example Jarnac programs, (including a 15 reaction model of glycolysis, a 

model of the calvin cycle and a structural model of </SMALL></FONT><FONT 

face=Verdana>T</FONT><SMALL><FONT face=Arial>he core pathways of Tryps brucei), 

a 49 page summary (in LaTeX and PDF) and a QuickStart document is supplied with 

the distribution.</FONT></SMALL></P>

		<P><STRONG><FONT face=Arial>Other points of interest:</FONT></STRONG></P>

		<P><FONT face=Arial size=3><B>Jarnac 2.0 also has an SBW interface (System 

Biology Workbench), this means Jarnac can be used as a server to provide 

simulation capabilities for alternative clients, such as Java based GUIs, 

pathway databases which require simulation capability, Web pages etc.&nbsp; In 

server mode Jarnac can be run invisibly in the background. The latest version of 

JDesigner has simulation capabilities which are provided by Jarnac via 

SBW.</B></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT face=Arial size=2>What is Jarnac written in?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT face=Arial size=2>For such a large project, a variety of languages 

are employed. These include Fortran and C/C++ for the numerical analysis and 

some core functionality, and Delphi 6 (Borland) for the main interface (GUI) 

elements. In this way we maximize each languages' strengths within the overall 

project. In terms of code size Jarnac comprises of 214,036 lines of compiled 

source code. This does not include the support DLLs, third-party GUI elements or 

commenting within the code itself.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT face=Arial size=2>Could Jarnac be compiled to run under 

Linux?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT face=Arial size=2>In principal yes, all the languages used to 

compile Jarnac are available on the Linux platform, including GUI 

support.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT face=Arial size=2>Is the source code available and what license is 

it distributed under?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT face=Arial size=2>Yes, just email me a request and I'll send you all 

the code. Jarnac is distributed under the LGPL license to allow greater 

flexibility.&nbsp;</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT face=Arial size=2>Can Jarnac be used in a commercial 

setting?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT face=Arial size=2>Yes, there are no restrictions except an 

acknowledgement that you are using code written by Herbert M 

Sauro</FONT></B></P>

======================<br>

<br>

1. The SBW API interface has been augmented with an additional<br>

simulation service to permit multiple model simulation.<br>

<br>

2. The stoichiometry matrix method, .sm was slow and with the introduction<br>

of complex types, used too much memory. It has now been greatly speeded up<br>

and is much more efficient with memory allocation. This was only<br>

a problem with very large models.<br>

<br>

3. Documentation has been updated.</font><P><FONT face=Arial><SMALL>Jarnac was demonstrated at the latest version at the

Changes.</B></SMALL><B><SMALL> version 1.19</SMALL></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Arial><FONT size=2>1. The network matrix property 'L' has been 

changed to 'LM'. 'L' is frequently used<BR>to mean Ligand in biochemistry. This 

change was made to restore the symbol 'L' to<BR>its more traditional role. To 

obtain the Reder L matrix for a network use p.LM instead&nbsp;<BR>of the usual 

p.L<BR></FONT></FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2><BR>2. The socket interface which 

allowed Jarnac to act as a server was broken,<BR>this crept in during the last 

release when the socket management code<BR>was changed.<BR><BR>3. New shell 

command, 'pwd', returns the current directory<BR><BR>4. Better printing 

facilities from the editor<BR><BR>5. SBW implementation in beta release with 

this version.<BR><BR>6. Launching of JDesigner from the tool bar is now achieved 

via SBW. If you<BR>wish to enable this feature then you must download the SBW

JDesigner with the<BR>SBW broker, you can do this by running JDesigner and from 

the options<BR>menu select register with SBW menu item.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Arial><SMALL><B>Latest Changes.</B></SMALL><B><SMALL> version 

1.18b</SMALL></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. Changes to a previous version of the scanner 

caused End line character&nbsp;<BR>to be miss-interpreted when the last item in 

an input line was a string.<BR>This meant that two return keys were required to 

cause Jarnac to<BR>compute the command line.<BR><BR>2. Added Print button to 

script editor to allow printing directly from the editor<BR><BR>3. Conflict 

between hardcopy print and console print keywords (oops). Therefore<BR>the 

hardcopy print shell command has been changed to 'HardCopy filename'<BR><BR>4. 

solve() function was passing the wrong number of arguments to the solver 

(bug<BR>introduced during a recent change to the calling mechanism)<BR><BR>5. 

Added a splash screen with status info<BR><BR>6. New Keypressed 

function<BR><BR>7. Complete rewrite of interface between Visual Designer and 

Jarnac. Visual designer<BR>is now a stand-alone application, communication to 

designer is via a socket interface.<BR><BR>8. Introduced new visual designer 

object to allow programmic control of JDesigner<BR><BR>9. Fixed a very annoying 

problem with comments interfering with model declarations</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Arial><B><SMALL>Latest Changes, 1.18a</SMALL></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. Problems when using edit command to load a new 

.jan file. After closing Jarnac, reopening Jarnac<BR>caused a list index out of 

bounds because the file name was saved under a slightly altered name.<BR>2. 

Added new function tau(x) which evaluates: 1/x * ln (1/rnd). Useful for 

implementing<BR>Gillespie's stochastic simulation algorithm. See stats.jan for 

details<BR>3. Added new property 'AsMolecules' to network object type. Enables 

easy conversion of amounts<BR>in moles to number of molecules and visa versa. eg 

p.AsMolecules ("S1") = 10e12;<BR>4. Added a few useful constants to the math.jan 

startup file<BR>5. Built-in editor has Drag &amp; Drop enabled, thus one can 

drag files from, say explorer<BR>and drop the file on to the editor panel.<BR>6. 

Associating jan files with Jarnac now works correctly, double click on a jan 

file<BR>(once you've associated jan files with Jarnac) and Jarnac will start and 

load the<BR>selected file into the built-in editor.<BR>7. Other internal 

changes, for example, Visual designer has been made more independent.<BR>8. The 

socket access to the Jarnac server has been changed so that an external 

client<BR>much first 'login' to the server - this is simply a security measure, 

see docs for details.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Arial><SMALL><B>Latest Changes.</B></SMALL><B><SMALL> version

<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. Enhancements to the editor: Multiple file editing, 

better search facilities<BR>2. Implementation of CVODE integrator (supplied as a 

DLL)<BR>3. XML import/export has been updated to conform to the the latest ERATO 

release documents on SBML standard model exchange format.<BR>4. Jarnac can now 

act as a server for remote requests, this is achieved by implementing a server 

socket. Any legal Jarnac script can<BR>be sent to a remote machine where Jarnac 

is running. In tests, we have successfully run a simulations from a Linux 

desktop machine using<BR>Python as the socket client. Python sample code is 

supplied in the documentation. Any machine or OS that supports standard BSD 

sockets may run Jarnac remotely. This change is part of a broader objective to 

open up Jarnac for remote and programatic access.<BR>5. Introduction of a new 

data type, 'code type'. The syntax for the sim.eval(), cc() and ee() methods 

have <B>changed</B> to accommodate code types.<BR>6. Documentation 

updated<BR></FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><FONT face=Arial>What can it do ?</FONT></STRONG> 

<P><FONT face=Arial><SMALL>Jarnac can be used as a general purpose language for 

performing </SMALL><SMALL>arithmetic</SMALL><SMALL> operations, including matrix

function or data grapher. The real usefulness of Jarnac however is its ability 

to manipulate, analyse and simulate </SMALL><SMALL>metabolic 

networks..</SMALL></FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Arial><SMALL>Jarnac is based on a simple control language, similar 

to the Basic language and supports many of the constructs one would 

expect,&nbsp; for loops, conditionals, while/do and repeat/until. It supports at

</SMALL><SMALL>Booleans</SMALL><SMALL>, strings, vectors, matrices and lists. 

Jarnac also supports user defined functions and external 

modules.</SMALL></FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Arial><SMALL>Metabolic support is similar to that found in SCAMP 

but more extensive and much more flexible. In principle there is no limit to the
