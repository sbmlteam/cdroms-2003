People,

My $0.02 worth on the diagram support.

I think Eric Minch focused on a critical point, also echoed
by Andrew Finney and others, about the importance of
separating "logical" from "physical" representations of
diagram layouts.

While admittedly I have not implemented a diagramming tool
myself and thus some of you will dismiss my opinion as
uninformed and meaningless, I think that given the goal of
providing transportable diagram representations in SBML, the
best approach is separating the logical structure of the
diagram from physical rendering characteristics such as
shapes, fonts, colors, etc.

As Eric pointed out, this distinction has been addressed
before.  I think it would be wise to pay attention to the
lessons learned by others who have attempted to reach out
beyond their specific software tools &amp; implementations and
connect to other systems.  For example, the notion of
stylesheets, coming most recently from HTML, makes eminent
sense here.  It is a scalable and proven concept.  I think
Andrew had an excellent idea, which is to push off the
descriptions of physical characteristics to stylesheets.

There is an obvious downside to this approach for those who
have already implemented tools which use a physical
representation approach.  This is regretful.  On the other
hand, it is likely that no matter what approach is chosen
for SBML, every tool will need to be modified to some
extent, so perhaps the burden of change will not fall solely
on one group of developers.

As far as developing a logical representation for SBML, one
approach might be to survey a subset of existing systems and
find an intersection of common themes.  Herbert has written
up JDesigner's diagram annotations, and there are probably
descriptions of other systems, or at least their developers
(the members of the DWG) could probably write brief
summaries fairly easily.  By following Andrew's proposed
procedure and using this survey as a starting point for
defining the minimal graph information, it seems to me the
DWG could make fairly rapid progress.
