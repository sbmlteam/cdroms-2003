Rational stoichiometries were specified in Level 1 for very good reason. I'd
like to know the difference that some found significant between a rational
and real number to be important enough to suggest removing the rational
stoichiometries. By loosing rational stoichiometries we loose some
advantages (significant advantages I think), by using the entire real number
set (within machine precision) some feel we gain more. The toss up between
the two depends on the balance of what we loose and what we gain.

Anyone know what these are, those in favour of floating point
stoichiometries should voice the advantages of the real number set over
rational numbers so that we can make a reasoned decision here. If there are
'real' advantages to using real over rational numbers then obviously we
should use them but lets make sure we know all the issues before we go for
one or the other.

There is one argument for using expressions for the stoichiometries, which
is the case when stoichiometries are a function of the state of the system,
happens sometimes with transport processes (known as slippage). If we do
(and we probably should) we will need to use MathML, sorry John, you might
have to have MathML after all in the stoichiometries (wish it could be
avoided).

Herbert Sauro

PS I agree with John that expressions in initial conditions would be nice.

I was under the impression that we'd be getting rid of the
denominator field altogether. What's the utility in expressing
a stoichiometric coefficient as 2.36435/12345? (That's not a
sarcastic remark, I'm wondering if there might be some kind
of use for it among, say, the stochastic folks, etc, that I'm not
seeing).

	  JWagner&gt; I know I expressed dissent in Ft. Lauderdale, but
	  JWagner&gt; after realizing that we'd already make
	  JWagner&gt; stoichiometric coefficients fractions, I with-
	  JWagner&gt; drew my objections to making them floats.
	
	  JWagner&gt; OTOH, making them MathML expressions seems to be
	  JWagner&gt; going a bit far--with no payback whatsoever
	  JWagner&gt; outside of the issue of having the same constant
	  JWagner&gt; in two places being error prone (I'd point out
	  JWagner&gt; that having the same MathML expression in two
	  JWagner&gt; places is equally, or, arguable, a LOT more,
	  JWagner&gt; error prone). Moreover, this "simplification"
	  JWagner&gt; means a big complication for developers, who
	  JWagner&gt; would now be forced to evaluate these MathML
	  JWagner&gt; expressions in their stoichiometry code. As
	  JWagner&gt; always, it's a matter of priorities, and we have
	  JWagner&gt; much bigger fish to fry (for example, I'd MUCH
	  JWagner&gt; rather allow initial conditions to be MathML
	  JWagner&gt; expressions--far more useful, with far more
	  JWagner&gt; payoff).
	
	OK, so if you're ok with allowing for floating point numbers
	in the 'stoichiometry' field, what is your feeling about the
	'denominator' field?  Should that remain an integer?
