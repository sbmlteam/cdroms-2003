&gt; Hi John,
Hi Kouichi,

&gt; I didn't intend to raise a new discussion on this but..
That's okay. Discussion is good. :)

&gt; &gt; S0, and S0 catalyzes E? Then you would have
&gt; &gt; S0 --E--&gt; S0*   with rate Kcat1*E*[S0]/(Km1 + [S0])
&gt; &gt; E --S0--&gt; E*    with rate Kcat2*S0*[E]/(Km2 + [E])
&gt; &gt; That is, you'd need different dimensions depending on use.
&gt; I don't think this is problematic, as long as we have an 
&gt; explicit way to indicate which are in conc. and which are
&gt; in amount. (such as Conc( S0 ), or [S0] or S0.Concentration,
&gt; or whatever)
Of course. I just think most of us would tend to think that
approach would be a bit bulky and a pain in the butt to deal
with in code. Such notation would end up in the KineticLaw
formula string, as in formula="Kcat1*E*[S0]/(Km1 + [S0])"
or formula="Kcat1*E*conc(S0)/(Km1 + conc(S0))" and I know
my simulator (and the Virtual Cell) would require some
work to deal with the extra notation.

&gt; Vcell is going beyond enzyme kinetics. You may agree with 
&gt; us that this flexibility to have both conc. and amount is
&gt; very helpful in cell biology modeling.
Oh, absolutely.

&gt; &gt; But, in the end, you aren't getting around the problem, because
&gt; &gt; if your volume changes, you'd *STILL* have to scale Km.
&gt; Something must be changed, depending on the pivot. I know you
&gt; have to change it because you want to preserve the reaction rate
&gt; and the substances. And the other case is to preserve rate 
&gt; constants and substances, allowing changes of the reaction rates.
Right. I don't see an easy way around it. So Joerg's initial
argument for solving this doesn't seem compelling. But, it
needs to be solved in the sense that everyone is not currently
respecting the unit conventions, and that probably means the
current unit convention needs to be modified.

The entire discussion boils down to two questions: do you want the
dimensions of species to be substance or concentration, and do you
want the dimensions of kineticLaws to be substance/time or
concentration/time? For me, it's concentration, and substance/time,
a solution that would require having a compartment's volume repre-
sented in a variable somehow. 

One suggestion was to have species be in units of substance,
and then when you write out a formula like "Kcat1*E*S0/(Km1 + S0)"
to convert the needed substances to concentrations, something like
"Kcat1*E*(S0/compartmentName)/(Km1 + S0/compartmentName)" where
"compartmentName" is the name of the compartment the species is
defined in, and represents the volume of that compartment (yes,
it's a bit bulky, but that name is already defined as unique
within the global namespace, so it is an easy way to fix things).

One thing is for certain, though, and that is, we have to start
paying attention to such details when we're coding. I will also
say that after checking all the SBML files that come with Gepasi
and JDesigner, I was unable to find a single reference anywhere
to units (that is, no unitDefinitions, and no units="..."
attributes), so it's pretty clear that we have all taken our
eyes off the ball with respect to units.

&gt; It seems this discussion is recurring. I'll stop here.
*L* Yeah. Do you know "The Song That Never Ends"?

&gt; &gt; As I said, there is no way around this, so we're going to
&gt; &gt; have to pick the lesser of two evils.
&gt; Agreed.
I *hate* it when that happens.
