I think rounding can easily be accounted for
with a rounded="3" kind of attribute on any
kind of shape that has vertices; the units on
the 3 would be pixels, and it would tell you
how much to round (ie. rounded="0" would be
the default, and indicate no rounding).

We might evenconsider handling all regular
polygons as a single case, like,
&lt;polygon vertices="4" rounded="3" width=...&gt;
would be a square (vertices=4) with corners
rounded 3 pixels. We could also add a
rotated="true" to rotate it theta/2, where
theta is the angle between adjacent vertices;
this could give us upside-down triangles,
for example, or diamonds instead of squares,
etc. Combined with width/height attributes
(which perform scaling), and the prescription
that scaling happens before rotation (or vice-
versa) would give us well-defined shapes.

Or maybe it's just much easier to define triangles,
rectangles, pentagons, hexagons, octagons and
call it good. :)

&gt;  
&gt; Yes indeed, I forgot about rounded squares, that should be 
&gt; included. As for
&gt; the residues sites I'm not sure what to do about that, I saw 
&gt; your document
&gt; on this and it's look good, in fact I should look at it again as I've
&gt; probably missed out a couple of shapes. The residue sites 
&gt; brings up a number
&gt; of issues which we should consider, how do we represent 
&gt; complex composite
&gt; shapes, eg a gene/promoter figures, or Hiroaki's residue sites?
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe we'll have to reconsider SVG after all, unless we can 
&gt; devise some
&gt; means of specifying composite shapes built from our basic 
&gt; shapes which I'm
&gt; sure we could. With composite sites another issues comes up, 
&gt; where should
&gt; reaction/interaction arrows end up when they approach a node? 
&gt; Shold they
&gt; point to the center of a node, or some particular aspect of a 
&gt; node shape, eg
&gt; a residue site on the node, or the promoter site on a gene 
&gt; shape? Lots of
&gt; issues to consider!

&gt; In CellDesigner, we use Square with round corners to 
&gt; represent protein.
&gt; and put small circles on it to represent specific residue site.
&gt; 
&gt; Hiroaki
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Here's an initial list of predefined shapes that might be useful:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Square (includes rectangle)
&gt; &gt; Circle (include ellipse)
&gt; &gt; Triangle
&gt; &gt; Pentagon
&gt; &gt; Hexagon
&gt; &gt; Parallelogram
&gt; &gt; Rhombus (rotated square?)
&gt; &gt; Heptagon
&gt; &gt; Octagon
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Plus any others not included but people would like.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; If these do end up in the spec we should also indicate algorithms in
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; spec doc (in some code perhaps) on how to draw these.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Noted. We should make sure and predefine
&gt; &gt; plenty of such shapes, as well as maybe
&gt; &gt; allow user-defined shapes that are reusable:
&gt; &gt; &lt;view&gt;
&gt; &gt; &lt;listOfShapes&gt;
&gt; &gt; &lt;shape name="Shape1" ...&gt;
&gt; &gt; &lt;shape name="Shape2" ...&gt;
&gt; &gt; &lt;/listOfShapes&gt;
&gt; &gt; &lt;diagram w="10" h="10" ...&gt;
&gt; &gt; &lt;glyph species="CytosolicCalcium" x="7" y="5" w="1"
&gt; &gt; h="2" shape="Shape1"&gt;
&gt; &gt; &lt;glyph species="CytosolicSodium" x="4" y="3" w="2" h="1"
&gt; &gt; shape="Shape2"&gt;
&gt; &gt; &lt;glyph species="CytosolicPotassium" x="4" y="3"
&gt; &gt; shape="PredefinedTriangle"&gt;
&gt; &gt; &lt;/diagram&gt;
&gt; &gt; &lt;/view&gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; One thing I didn't like about SVG was the lack of support for 
&gt; &gt; &gt; predefined
&gt; &gt; &gt; shapes such as triangles, hexagons etc. I know one can 
&gt; &gt; &gt; specify then using
&gt; &gt; &gt; straight coordinates but ....

&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; As I said, I had only looked at it recently,
&gt; &gt; &gt; but at the time I wasn't really thinking about
&gt; &gt; &gt; using SVG in its entirety, just maybe borrowing
&gt; &gt; &gt; pieces of it. SVG is a spec for painting vector-
&gt; &gt; &gt; based graphics, whereas what we want is something
&gt; &gt; &gt; that tells us how to lay out our pathways--far
&gt; &gt; &gt; less difficult, and much more specific.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Some of its constructs, however, could be
&gt; &gt; &gt; useful. For example, how it specifies colors,
&gt; &gt; &gt; shapes, lines/curves could be used to our
&gt; &gt; &gt; purposes. For example, I kind of like their
&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;defs&gt;...&lt;/defs&gt;, something *like* that could
&gt; &gt; &gt; be useful for defining standard shapes/elements.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; As to my first point, about lots of optional
&gt; &gt; &gt; detail...my idea is that we allow tools to
&gt; &gt; &gt; export a fairly detailed description of their
&gt; &gt; &gt; diagram(s), and, upon importing a model, they
&gt; &gt; &gt; can simply ignore anything they don't want to
&gt; &gt; &gt; (or can't) deal with. For example, the Virtual
&gt; &gt; &gt; Cell will export many, many diagrams, all but
&gt; &gt; &gt; one of which JDesigner will iggy. When JDesigner
&gt; &gt; &gt; exports a layout, it might specify that species
&gt; &gt; &gt; are to be drawn as red rectangles with black
&gt; &gt; &gt; borders; the Virtual Cell, when it imports that
&gt; &gt; &gt; layout, will say, "Herbert wanted red rects with
&gt; &gt; &gt; black borders...bummer...looks like little yellow
&gt; &gt; &gt; circles it is". This fits with the idea of allow-
&gt; &gt; &gt; ing a very fine level of detail in the diagrams.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Best example is the size thing: let's allow a
&gt; &gt; &gt; size to be specified, and any tool that doesn't
&gt; &gt; &gt; have a size-based approach can simply iggy it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I can live with SVG so long as someone is willing to write 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the parser for it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (portable C please), it's not pure XML so it might be some 
&gt; &gt; &gt; work at the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; software end.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; First, it looks like we are not going to use the forum.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Several members expressed that they'd much prefer
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to use email. (That's why I didn't reply to your email
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; earlier, Pedro.)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That said, without an indexing by working group
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and topic, this is pretty unworkable, especially
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; given the tremendous volume of discussion now
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and, most likely, in the future; 39 of my last 50
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; email messages have been sbml-discuss--and I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have purposefully not sent any DWG messages
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out. What a complete pain in the ass.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now, for the preliminary issues:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. It appears that some groups want a LOT of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; flexibility in diagrams, others want very little.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Can we all agree on the general approach of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "lots of optional details"? 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. A number of people have suggested SVG
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; might be a viable approach. I hadn't read up
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on it until recently, but now that I have, I can
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; see some distinct advantages. What is everyone's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; initial view on this: do you think SVG would
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be a good/viable approach, or would it be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; too much of a pain in the butt for people to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; jump on board?
