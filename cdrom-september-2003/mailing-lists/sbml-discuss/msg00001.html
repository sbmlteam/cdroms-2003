Hi folks,

I couldn't resist commenting on this. Naturally from a CellML-centric
viewpoint, 
but I believe my comments hold for SBML too.

Nicolas Le Novere wrote:
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not sure I share this view. SBML should not only be a language to 
&gt; exchange models, but also to store models.

As far as I'm concerned, CellML should only be used for the exchange of
models, 
and not for storage. And to ensure that it can be used by as many tools
as 
possible, CellML is as generic as possible, with compliant processors
only 
really having to be able to link together variables declared in
different nodes 
in a network, and be able to run simulations involving a system of ODEs.
It was 
intended that tool-specific optimisations be encoded as extensions,
where 
possible. Massive domain- and problem-level optimisations could be made,
but at 
the expense of compliance.

I also think that CellML is a really bad option for storage. In general
XML 
documents are much more difficult and inefficient to deal with (load,
grep, 
etc.) than unstructured text files, which are traditionally what
modelling tools 
have used to store information. As more and more biological information
is put 
in databases, it is only a matter of time before everyone starts
throwing their 
models in too, and CellML was designed with this in mind.

I would suggest to the developers of simulators with established text
file 
formats to stick with those formats as the primary export mechanism.
SBML 
(and/or CellML) is an additional format which will almost always be
lossy, but 
which can be used by other tools.

&gt; Obviously all simulators do not
&gt; need the same level of details. That does not mean we don't have to
allow
&gt; for the possibility to store all the information we possess. And the
&gt; package system proposed in the document "miscellaneous features" is
perfect
&gt; for that.

As you point out, if you want to avoid the loss, then extension
mechanisms are 
available in both languages. The use of XML namespaces makes these much
more 
explicit than the extensions that were added to HTML by M$/NS. So you're
welcome 
to use either language as a storage format too.

I believe we need to slow down the development of these languages and
take more 
time to establish what people need and what the tools can reasonably
support, 
otherwise no software will ever be compliant.

The W3C's system, where it is required that three tools support a
standard 
before it becomes a recommendation, has worked pretty well for them in
ensuring 
that their recommendations are stable and error-free. Why not use it as
the 
basis for extending SBML? For instance, if someone creates an extension
element, 
document it, and persuades the authors of two other tools to include
support for 
it, then and only then can it possible for that feature to be added to
the next 
revision of the SBML standard.

Regards,
Warren Hedley
