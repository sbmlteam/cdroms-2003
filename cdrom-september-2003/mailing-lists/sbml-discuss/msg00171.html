Andrew,

I'd like to participate in the "Arrays" working group, although I would
prefer it be called the "Collections" working group so as not to
prejudge the answer to your question about whether they should allow
Sets, Bags, OrderedCollections, Sorted Collections, Dictionaries, etc.

My own view, which is biased by my experience doing simulations in
Smalltalk rather than C, is that Arrays improperly mix three separate
concepts: collections, indexing and iteration.

- The Collection concept provides the ability to refer to a bunch (i.e.,
collection) of elements as "one thing,"  typically when the program
needs to pass the whole bunch at once, e.g., as an argument, to some
function.

- The indexing concept is about how to refer to a particular element.
In many cases, especially when the collection contains elements that are
distributed evenly in space or time, naming the elements with an integer
is exactly what you want to do.  But when the natural organization of
the elements is not isomorphic to a one-dimensional physical axis with
evenly spaced elements, integers become cryptic and arbitrary names that
don't offer much modeling power.  So, for example, a Dictionary is a
collection in which names (or keys) other than integers can be used.
[note, the implementation of a dictionary is usually a relatively sparse
array in which the names are converted to indices by a hash function]

- The iteration concept is about the order in which a program wishes to
access, store, or modify the elements, usually with the implicit
understanding that all elements are to be dealt with.  For example, in
an OrderedCollection, iteration is intended to start at the first
element and proceed successively to the end (or sometimes backwards from
last to first).  In a SortedCollection, the intent is to start with the
smallest element (not smallest index) and proceed to the largest (again,
one may want to go backwards).  Other kinds of collection (e.g., Set or
Bag) explicitly ignore order, i.e., they explicitly assert that the
order of iteration is undefined or irrelevant.

At the implementation level, when a simulation is running,  arrays are
almost always the implementation of choice.  SBML, however, is a model
description language quite separate from the simulation.  It seems to me
that modelers might like to be able to make richer or more nuanced
statements about indexing and iteration than those allowed by Arrays.
They may want to index elements by names rather than integers.  They may
want to indicate that the order in which the elements appear in the XML
text is, or is not, important.  They may want to indicate that iteration
should proceed in a sort order, e.g., smallest to largest, however the
elements appear in the list of XML.  And so forth.  Thus, if SBML
allowed collection tags other than Array, the modeler could use them to
indicate to the consumer of the model whether the order of elements in
the list is important or not. If it allowed Dictionaries, one could use
/key and /value tags to name elements rather than referring to them with
some arbitrary integer.

Charter of the SBML Arrays Working Group
----------------------------------------

Background

At the recent SBML forum meeting in Florida it was decided to setup
working groups to develop proposals for incorporation into SBML.
Several people at the meeting signed up to a working group to develop a
proposal for arrays in SBML

Mission Statement and Scope

Definition of an extension to SBML to allow the construction
of models from homogeneous collections of objects.  Attributes of these
objects can vary systematically across these collections.

Any viable proposal must:

- support a mechanism for describing the connections between array
elements
- be compatible with other proposals in particular model composition and
dynamic structures

Main issues to resolve:

- What objects can occur in these collections?
- What is the correct mechanism for defining collections?
             for example should we consider sets, bags etc as
alternatives
             to arrays.
- Do we need syntactic sugar to simplify the use of or compress the
encoding of arrays?
- Should a function for defining the sparseness of an array be dynamic
             (vary during simulation)?

Termination criterion:

   Arrays is included into the SBML Level 3

   or

   The idea is considered as nonsense for Systems-Biology and dropped
   from the SBML Agenda

   Timeframe: I expect a working proposal and first reference
   implementations for the next SBML Forum Meeting in
   Nov 2003 S. Louis

Deliverables:

   - a Array proposal for incorporation into SBML L3
   - a reference implementation that can read and write the proposed
standard including L2 in a
     useful software context
   - at least one published model encoded in the proposal
   - optional: a tool that can translate from the proposed standard
including SBML L2 to
     unextended SBML L2.
