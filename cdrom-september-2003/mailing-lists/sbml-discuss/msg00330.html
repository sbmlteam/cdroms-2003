We wholeheartedly disagree with the notion of
associating reactions with compartments, as in
the general case, a reaction involves species from
several compartments; with which compartment is
PIP2 hydrolysis associated, the membrane or the
cytosol? The same applies to fluxes across membranes
(transport processes) where the natural units are
substance/area/time, and to choose the volume of one
compartment over another is a completely arbitrary
decision.
 
The point is, no matter what, you will end up with
*something* that has to scale with volume.

	&gt; There is still a huge hole in the reaction rate
	&gt; thing if the rate law's net units are allowed to
	&gt; be substance/volume/time, because there is only
	&gt; one well-defined way to interpret the volume
	&gt; inherent in the rate, and that is in terms of
	&gt; "total volume of all compartments". Thus, changing
	&gt; any volumes at all would mean that rate constants
	&gt; have to be changed as well. That is to say, in
	&gt; your
	
	I agree (and have always stated this) that the overall reaction rate
	should be in substance/time. The only alternative would be for a
	reaction to be associated to a compartment, because then the volume of
	the compartment where the reaction takes place ("cell" in the above
	formula) could be inferred. For transport processes, explicit volumes of
	the two compartments involved) would still appear in the formula.
	
	&gt;
	&gt;&gt;formula="cell * (Vm * S0)/(Km + S0) "
	&gt;
	&gt; the only way to allow such a formulation is if
	&gt; Vm is in terms of total volume (the sum of the
	&gt; volumes of all compartments), which is obviously
	&gt; why you had to multiply by "cell".
	&gt;
	&gt; And that is to say that, while in your approach
	&gt; you don't have to change initial conditions, you
	&gt; instead have to change reaction rates (like Vm
	&gt; in your example).
	&gt;
	I am afraid, I am not quite with you here.
	
	&gt;
	&gt;&gt;I disagree with Nicholas who wants to remove the
	&gt;&gt;two different units used for the species id by
	&gt;&gt;making a species id in a rate law represent
	&gt;&gt;amout, not concentration.
	&gt;
	&gt; I'm with Nicolas on this one, unless someone can
	&gt; see a way around it.
	
	What follows is not an argument about the units of substance ID in rate
	laws:
	
	 &gt; All I know is, it's far
	&gt; superior if the overall units of rate laws are
	&gt; substance/time, since that always works independent
	&gt; of which compartments species are in.
	
	We all agree with that, and that is also why the current and
	future standard says that these are the units of the rate law.
