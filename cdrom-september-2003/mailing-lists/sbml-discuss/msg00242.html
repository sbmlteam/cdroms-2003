As I said, I had only looked at it recently,
but at the time I wasn't really thinking about
using SVG in its entirety, just maybe borrowing
pieces of it. SVG is a spec for painting vector-
based graphics, whereas what we want is something
that tells us how to lay out our pathways--far
less difficult, and much more specific.

Some of its constructs, however, could be
useful. For example, how it specifies colors,
shapes, lines/curves could be used to our
purposes. For example, I kind of like their
&lt;defs&gt;...&lt;/defs&gt;, something *like* that could
be useful for defining standard shapes/elements.

As to my first point, about lots of optional
detail...my idea is that we allow tools to
export a fairly detailed description of their
diagram(s), and, upon importing a model, they
can simply ignore anything they don't want to
(or can't) deal with. For example, the Virtual
Cell will export many, many diagrams, all but
one of which JDesigner will iggy. When JDesigner
exports a layout, it might specify that species
are to be drawn as red rectangles with black
borders; the Virtual Cell, when it imports that
layout, will say, "Herbert wanted red rects with
black borders...bummer...looks like little yellow
circles it is". This fits with the idea of allow-
ing a very fine level of detail in the diagrams.

Best example is the size thing: let's allow a
size to be specified, and any tool that doesn't
have a size-based approach can simply iggy it.

&gt; I can live with SVG so long as someone is willing to write 
&gt; the parser for it
&gt; (portable C please), it's not pure XML so it might be some work at the
&gt; software end.

&gt; Subject: [sbml-discuss] DWG preliminary issues
&gt; 
&gt; First, it looks like we are not going to use the forum.
&gt; Several members expressed that they'd much prefer
&gt; to use email. (That's why I didn't reply to your email
&gt; earlier, Pedro.)
&gt;  
&gt; That said, without an indexing by working group
&gt; and topic, this is pretty unworkable, especially
&gt; given the tremendous volume of discussion now
&gt; and, most likely, in the future; 39 of my last 50
&gt; email messages have been sbml-discuss--and I
&gt; have purposefully not sent any DWG messages
&gt; out. What a complete pain in the ass.
&gt;  
&gt; Now, for the preliminary issues:
&gt;  
&gt; 1. It appears that some groups want a LOT of
&gt; flexibility in diagrams, others want very little.
&gt; Can we all agree on the general approach of
&gt; "lots of optional details"? 
&gt;  
&gt; 2. A number of people have suggested SVG
&gt; might be a viable approach. I hadn't read up
&gt; on it until recently, but now that I have, I can
&gt; see some distinct advantages. What is everyone's
&gt; initial view on this: do you think SVG would
&gt; be a good/viable approach, or would it be
&gt; too much of a pain in the butt for people to
&gt; jump on board?
