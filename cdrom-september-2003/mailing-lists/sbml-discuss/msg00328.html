I guess the way I was thinking about the whole math display is...
 
Either a program wants to display math in a nice and formatted
manner, or it doesn't. Those that don't want to display formatted
math simply won't display formatted math. But, those that *do*
want to display formatted math are faced with doing the drawing
and layout themselves. For *those* applications, it would be very
helpful to have the MathML, because it basically specifies the
layout for you.
 
For example, in the Virtual Cell, when you type in an expression
like (a+b)/(c+d/e), Jim Schaff has written a very nice algorithm
that takes the expression tree as input and outputs a "format tree"
very similar to the MathML display.
 
So I was thinking it might make it easier for those people wanting
to do something like that.

	I fully agree that both options are far from optimal, especially the
	second one since you need all those programs installed. On the other
	hand, it seems to work as long as there is no other option.
	Actually a java lib would not be that bad I think. Since the new gcc
	compiler can compile java code to machine byte code, it should be
	possible to create a normal library from java code and then write some
	wrappers for perl, python, etc.
	Maybe I am wrong. Has anybody else played around with the gcc java
	compiler yet?

	&gt; All very well on paper but how do we programmers implement it? Someone
	&gt; earlier mentioned that they only knew of two portable libs (maybe) that
	&gt; could render MathML, a GTK method and a long winded approach to convery
	&gt; MathML to Latex, etc etc. Neither method sounds appleaing.
	&gt;
	&gt; I'm sure there is a Java lib somewhere but that isn't of much use to
	&gt; many of
	&gt; use who use other languages.

	&gt;&gt; There was also some discussion in Florida about display
	&gt;&gt; MathML, and I got to thinking about it...it seems like we
	&gt;&gt; could include display MathML markup in the Diagrams
	&gt;&gt; portion. Imagine if, in addition to diagrams for the
	&gt;&gt; reaction pathways, we also had a list of MathML display
	&gt;&gt; elements that are linked to the various MathML expressions
	&gt;&gt; in the SBML document.
	&gt;&gt;
	&gt;&gt; I was thinking of an addition to something like JDesigner
	&gt;&gt; such that when you hovered the pointer over a reaction
	&gt;&gt; arrow, you got a "tooltips" like action that popped up a
	&gt;&gt; tooltip window, and in it was displayed that reaction's
	&gt;&gt; kinetics; this MathML display element could provide the
	&gt;&gt; layout for the content (just as an example).
	&gt;&gt;
	&gt;&gt; However, someone--maybe me?--poninted out that we
	&gt;&gt; all pretty much knew how to do the math display anyway,
	&gt;&gt; so it wasn't clear to me if there was any consensus that
	&gt;&gt; display MathML was needed. Anyone care to weigh in
	&gt;&gt; on this? Poul, any comments?
	&gt; MathML provides mechanisms to combine content and presentation markup.
	&gt; Chapter 5 of the MathML 2.0 specification is devoted to just this
	&gt; issue. It seems pretty straightforward to tie the two together to
	&gt; enable the behaviour that you describe above.
