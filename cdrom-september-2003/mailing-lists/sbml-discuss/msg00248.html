I brought up the issue of membranes, on behalf
of the Virtual Cell group, in Florida, so I
thought I should say something about this here.

First, we HAVE TO HAVE membranes. It's an
absolute show-stopper for us. We've been
asking for them for about two years now,
and we can't properly build a Virtual Cell
model from SBML without them.

So we've put out two general approaches, as
Andrew listed. The first is a quickie fix with
no impact on existing tools: add an optional
spatialDimension attribute to the compartment
element, with a default of 3. So long as the
units on reactions continues to be substance
per time (not concentration per time, as most
tools currently assume), this should work.

It isn't, however, what we *really* want.
What we really want is a completely separate
element, called membrane; this element will
then serve as a container for all of the
*other* membrane pieces we want/need, in
particular, all the crap that goes along
with membrane potentials. To this end, we
want a membrane element that is on par with
the current compartment element. Imagine:
&lt;listOfCompartments&gt;
	&lt;compartment name="Extracellular" volume="1" ...&gt;
	&lt;membrane name="PlasmaMembrane"  area="17" outside="Extracellular" ...&gt;
	&lt;compartment name="Cytosol"  volume="1" outside="PlasmaMembrane" ...&gt;
&lt;/listOfCompartments&gt;
where obviously the &lt;membrane&gt; element's area would
have units of area (that is, something like a user-defined
units="squareMicrons").

The obvious approach is, as Andrew said,
to create a common parent class for both
membrane and compartment elements (he called
it a "space"--good name for it, Andrew!).
Thus, we'd end up with something like:

	Class: Space extends SBase
	name: SName
	outside: Space
	units: SName

	Class: Membrane extends Space
	area: double

	Class: Compartment extends Space
	volume: double

We would also suggest changing "listOfCompartments"
to "listOfSpaces", and of course, the "compartment"
attribute in the Species element would be renamed
"space". 

Also, Joerg's "initialAmount" discussion
would have to get settled keeping in mind
that some species live in membranes, not
compartments; we would simply suggest keeping the
units as "substance" (and for reaction rates,
keeping substance/time), since that would
work regardless of whether you were talking
membranes or compartments.

Our original thought was to go with the first
(simpler) approach for Level 2, and wait until
Level 3 for the more complicated (but flexible
and "pure") solution, but it was suggested that
maybe people might just want to jump in and do
it now. (That is, why put off until tomorrow
what you know you can endure today?) Also,
doing it now, in the context of getting units
"correct" makes a bit of sense as well, as
someone else pointed out.

Obviously, we'd very definitely prefer the
second solution in Level 2.

We'd like to hash this out and come to a
consensus in time for settling Level 2,
and point out that we do NOT consider Andrew's
"Plan A: make no changes in this respect
to SBML" to be an option.

Hope this clarifies the discussion some,
John

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Here is another question regarding finalizing the definition
&gt; of SBML Level 2.  
&gt; 
&gt; The Florida meeting felt that SBML should incorporate a concept for
&gt; differentiating between compartments and membranes.  To help this
&gt; process do you agree that SBML L2 V1 should:
&gt; 
&gt; a) make no changes in this respect to SBML
&gt; 
&gt; b) add a new positive integer "spatialDimension" attribute to
&gt; "compartment"
&gt;       and replace the "volume" attribute by "size" on "compartment".
&gt;       "spatialDimension" will default to 3 and can never be 
&gt; less than 1.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; c) create a super class "spaces" subclassing "compartment" and
&gt; "membrane"
&gt;       from it. "Compartment" would have a "volume" attribute and
&gt; "Membrane"
&gt;       would have an "area" attribute.
&gt; 
&gt; Options (b) and (c) will require some modification to the 
&gt; default units
&gt; scheme
&gt; for membrane area and for the amount of species placed on membranes.
&gt; Assuming
&gt; that (b) or (c) above are accepted the options are:
&gt; 
&gt; a) have no default units for membrane area or for species amount for
&gt; species
&gt;       placed on a membrane.  This implies that valid SBML 
&gt; would have to
&gt; include
&gt;       unit definitions for these cases.
&gt; 
&gt; b) create a new built-in unit "area" and use this to create default
&gt; units for
&gt;       membrane area and for species amount for species placed on a
&gt; membrane.
&gt; 
&gt; Please reflect on and discuss this issue on the list.  The 
&gt; voting system
&gt; will be
&gt; enabled beginning this Friday and we will post voting information at
&gt; that time.
&gt; 
&gt; If you have questions about this topic or the reason for the vote,
&gt; please feel
&gt; free to call Mike or Andrew directly.
&gt; 
&gt; -- Mike &amp; Andrew
