I don't understand the issue, it's still a case of making sure your units
are compatible whether you have changing volumes or not. If you can't make
your units compatible then there is something wrong with the model.

Jarnac supports multiple volumes, what it doesn't support are changing
volumes (as part of the model, of course you can change volumes in betweeen
integration steps, but that's not the same thing). I only know one published
model (or series of models) which use changing volumes so I didn't think the
omission was a great loss. In the future, for generality sake changing
volumes will be included.

JDesigner supports multiple volumes but not changing volumes (Since it uses
Jarnac as the simulation backend). The way one deals with multiple volume
systems is to make sure that you define your rates in terms of amounts per
unit time, the simulator expect this and will automatically adjust for
different volumes as it integrates.

The user doesn't have to include any conversion rules, other than making
sure that rates express changes in amounts, the rest is taken care of
autmatically. For a single unit volume, rates can be in concentrations per
unit time or amounts, it dones't matter.

SBML provides the posibility of defining compartments and specify 
volumes. Species provisions are made for rules that change the volumes. 
If a model uses volumes that change in time and second order reactions 
appear in the model, it is not possible to ensure that your units are 
compatible, no matter whether you have a PhD or not. You need the volume

to convert between quantities of molecules and concentrations, or you 
need a modelling tool that is able to do this for you.

I read somewhere (this might be out of date), that Jarnac assumes a 
single compartment with unit volume (constant in time), so for this tool

the issue does not appear. Changing volumes can still be modeled, but 
then the volume would be a separate variable that would probably appear 
in SBML as a substance.

JDesigner does allow the creation of compartments, and specification of 
their volume, though how they are used is unclear to me ( I am working 
on linux and have not installed JDesigner).

An example of the complications that appear even with fixed volumes is 
the following:

Imagine two compartments with different volumes and a transport process 
between the two. Transporting one molecule between the two compartments 
has a different effect on the concentrations in the two volumes: in the 
smaller volume the change in concentration is proportionally larger. So 
where does this information go?
Does the user have to include the conversion between molecule numbers 
and concentrations in the kineticLaw formula?

I have appended an SBML example file, which does not include the 
rescaling, but uses numbers of molecules for substance definitions. The 
problematic point here is that the kinetic law should really be
&lt;kineticLaw formula="(KcF * MEMBRANE_Enzyme  * compA_X)/( KmS + 
(compA_X/compA.volume))"&gt;

instead of

&lt;kineticLaw formula="(KcF * MEMBRANE_Enzyme  * compA_X)/( KmS +
compA_X)"&gt;

but how does one access the volume (here I used compA.volume, but such 
usage is not defined anywhere)?

Note also that
&lt;kineticLaw formula="uui(compA_X, KcF * MEMBRANE_Enzyme, KmS)"&gt;
would be incorrect,  while
&lt;kineticLaw formula="compA.volume * uui(compA_X/compA.volume, KcF * 
MEMBRANE_Enzyme, KmS)"&gt;
would be correct.

tools

In
&gt;SBML if you don't specify units then the numbers can mean what ever the
&gt;modeller intended. 
&gt;
The SBML specification says that the default unit for substances is 
"mole", not whatever the modeller intends!

&gt;For real models one should of course indicate somewhere
&gt;in the SBML what the basic units are. 
&gt;
&gt;I don't think this is an unreasonable requirement for the user to do, I
&gt;presume that our users are scientists (i.e they have PhDs etc) and will
&gt;understand the importance of compatible units!
&gt;  
&gt;
Most scientists are well aware of this, that is why there is a separate 
notation for concentrations
and molecule numbers: [X] is the concentration of species X. It is only 
for convenience that the [] is often left out.
