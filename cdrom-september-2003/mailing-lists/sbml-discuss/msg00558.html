Folks

We have not designed SBML around what can be validated by 
XML schema parsing and I don't believe that it is a
good idea to start.  (I think it is a good idea to
use XML schema and we'll continue to produce schemas
as we go.)  

John has identified several good reasons for this thinking.
Given a choice between a simple approach that gets the job done
and supporting strict schema validation I think we should
pursue the simple option.  At the end of the day some software
has to interpret the XML structure in some form and any additional
complexity can lead to misinterpretation.

Note that some tools will chose not to use XML schema
perhaps using an alternative or implementing its own
valiadation, for performance reasons or other implementation
constraints.
Note also that the role XML schema is not just for validation,
it can also be used to generate code or schemas in other
forms.  I think a design based around strict validation 
probably would not lend itself to good code generation.

The form of SBML should mimic the forms already 
being used within software where possible.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Then why stop there? Let's define point2D and point3D,
&gt; line2D and line3D, rectangle2D and rectangle3D. I know,
&gt; why don't we define model0D, model1D, model2D and model3D?
&gt; And function1, function2, function3, etc, depending upon
&gt; how many arguments a function takes?
&gt; 
&gt; Where it makes sense, we should use the schema to
&gt; constrain the attribute set. But we're not just
&gt; talking about modifying the schema, we're also
&gt; talking about modifying the spec, and that is
&gt; very worrisome to me.
&gt; 
&gt; I would also point out that when given the chance
&gt; to do something very similar with respect to
&gt; membranes, we chose not to do so, even though it
&gt; made a lot of sense to do so--even more sense than
&gt; the layout issue. Instead, we chose to use a
&gt; single element (compartment) and add a
&gt; spatialDimensions attribute. As a consequence,
&gt; if/when we add membrane potential, we will not
&gt; be able to constrain compartments/membranes
&gt; with respect to membrane potential in the
&gt; schema. This was a very conscious choice.
&gt; 
&gt; Finally, keep in mind that most of the enforcement
&gt; of the spec is not really possible to do in the
&gt; schema. Does the schema ensure that all reactants,
&gt; products and modifiers used in a reaction are
&gt; species? Does the schema ensure that we have no
&gt; cycles in the compartment hierarchy? Does the
&gt; schema enforce the constraint that referenced
&gt; user-defined functions must exist in the list of
&gt; functions? Did we design units in such a way that
&gt; all the yucky details underlying units could be
&gt; implemented in the schema? Nope.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I strongly support Kevin's point. The XML schema can, and 
&gt; should be used to put constraints on the attribute set of elements.
&gt; 
&gt; To get back to the subject, having layout2d and layout3d 
&gt; makes it possible to define attributes (or sub-elements) in 
&gt; layout3d that are optional in a 3D layout and have nothing to 
&gt; do in layout2D (these attributes and elements can be absent 
&gt; from layout2D altogether).
&gt; 
&gt; In my opinion, this is a better solution that what John 
&gt; suggests, because if we put attributes x,y, and z in layout 
&gt; to represent both 2D and 3D layout the z attribute must be 
&gt; defined both for 2D AND 3D layouts. This is just a simple 
&gt; example, but consider that other attributes and elements may 
&gt; be needed in the future in a 3D layout element).
&gt; 
&gt; There is an intelligent way to use XML schemas to make the 
&gt; choice apparent to both humans and software. We can use this 
&gt; method and benefit from validation schema support. My 
&gt; experinece is that it will come handy when maintaining the 
&gt; exchange format, if/when people think it is time to have 
&gt; backward compatible changes to the spec), or we can just 
&gt; continue relying on a bunch of assumptions that developers 
&gt; may or may not remember and implement in their code 
&gt; (especially if they do not read the spec, as John suggested).

&gt; However, if you would be happy with just having "layout" 
&gt; elements but with a "dimensions=" attribute (similar to what 
&gt; we do with
&gt; compartments) I could go with that. This would deal with the 
&gt; important issues you have raised. Also, in this approach, the 
&gt; "unexpected" z, d, etc values would not be unexpected, and 
&gt; besides, don't take a single line of code or a moment's time 
&gt; to ignore.
&gt; 
&gt; John
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Actually, that was my first thought. Unfortunately, unless 
&gt; I'm reading the specs incorrectly, XML Schema doesn't seem to 
&gt; like this. I mean, you could define the attribute, and even 
&gt; require it, but it would appear impossible to define 
&gt; different attribute constraints on the descendent elements 
&gt; based solely on that attribute value. I'm basing this 
&gt; conclusion as much on some bboard discussions and on this 
&gt; guideline I found
&gt; (<A  HREF="http://www.xfront.com/VariableContentContainers.html">http://www.xfront.com/VariableContentContainers.html</A>) as on 
&gt; the spec itself, which is pretty tough to read.
&gt; 
&gt; And as I thought about it, I decided this is in fact a 
&gt; feature, as it gives that tiny extra nudge to lazy 
&gt; implementors (not that there's anything wrong with that) to 
&gt; not ignore it, and I think on balance that's a good thing. 
&gt; And I'm guessing I can easily make it more trouble to 
&gt; continue arguing with me about it than it would be to just 
&gt; deal with it... ; )
