Hello Victoria,

I agree that we have the need for multicellular models and that this kind of modelling will become more important in the future. But I disagree that SBML should become a meta language. 

The large models you are talking about will most likely not be handled by humans directly. Graphical editing tools need to be and are developed to handle those.

For these tools handling large files (creating and reading) is not a problem. If you need to save storage space there is the option of compressed xml (but that is not human readable).

I do not see any advantage in saying something like (free text):

"I have 10 reactions varying in the name by a subscript and all species involved are also indexed by the same subscript except species A."

This are compilation instructions you would give to a program. Therefore, to correctly implement SBML a program must have a build in compiler.

The same can be achieved by creating 10 reactions which are individually described in SBML. This approach is possible today with SBML 1 and 2. 

In my opinion complicating SBML will limit its adoption in the modelling community.

As Pedro said SBML does not need an enhancement like the above to achieve the goal of representing large models with repetitive elements. 

I would very much like to see SBML becoming a broad adopted standard. Complicating it is counterproductive.

&gt; Stefan,

&gt; I would like to refer you to "SBML Level 2 Proposal: Array Features" by Andrew
&gt; Finney at all. In this proposal SBML DOES NOT generate the model with arrays, 
&gt; it only describes the arrays and connections between compartments in concise 
&gt; manner, therefore it stores model information (such as array bounds and types 
&gt; of interactions between cells) without generating actual arrays and without 
&gt; performing any operations and/or interactions. 
&gt; 
&gt; I also disagree with the statement that repeating information for each element 
&gt; of the array is not a problem (since large models will be created and handled 
&gt; pragmatically). We are working with multicellular organisms and our applications 
&gt; will be executed on parallel platforms. Connections between cells will obey same 
&gt; set of rules, but there will be millions of such connections. Often humans will 
&gt; need to examine SBML files, often humans will have to create them. But even if 
&gt; that was not true, saving and passing around huge files with millions of 
&gt; connections is impractical. 
&gt; 
&gt; I understand that arrays has been postponed to Level 3, so it is not urgent to 
&gt; dwell on this issue right now. Nevertheless, multicellular models are studied in 
&gt; our group and are read and produced by our software. Popularity of such models in 
&gt; the future is beyond any doubt and is supported by big advances in the field of 
&gt; parallel computing. It will be a mistake to totally ignore array representation 
&gt; in SBML or to postpone it till indefinite future.
&gt; 
&gt; Victoria.
