I think this is the main point.  I wonder if there is an unintentional
equivocation in the discussion in which the word "stoichiometry"
really means different things in different simulations.  For example,
i think stoichiometry should mean the number of molecules (integers!)
required for a reaction.  A stochastic simulators needs the numbers to
mean this in order to do the statistics correctly.  In a flux
analysis, the stoichiometry is similar and says the relative ratio
between the velocity of a reaction and the rate of change of a
species....BUT, in that case there is a reasonable extension to
positive reals to accomodate phenomenological models: as Martin
pointed out, it lets one put in drains to biomass formation without
giving the actual, detailed chemistry of the drain.

If a stochastic simulator were to look at the "reactions" in a model
that were of this kind (floats giving drains on metabolites into
biomass), there is really nothing it can do.  Or, to the extent I
can cook up ways to cope, I'm not sure it _should_ because the
underlying model means something fundamentally different from what
is intended in a stochastic approach.

So, I'm wondering if we are coming back to a recurring problem in
which we want SBML to express any model, but then we fuzz our
thinking over to a stance in which any model should be interpretable
by any program and from there to every SBML statement should work
make sense for any program.  Since the semantic content of the
models aimed at different simulators can be different, indeed can
be inconsistent, that just doesn't seem a viable plan.

Going further with this, suggestions made in this discussion to deduce
what is intended by sniffing at whether the given stoichiometric
factor is integer or not integer seems ill advised.  It may seem a
simple deduction now, but in fact I think we are talking about trying
to deduce the overall intention of a model by poking at its local
features.  Not only do I worry that this is not possible, but just
as troublesome, is the observation that this would be a terrible
violation of encapsulation.  You can be sure that the N different
simulators will sniff and deduce in different manners, leading to
different interpretation of the model.

Instead, I think the intention of the model needs to somehow be stated
up front.  A simulator can look at that and decide whether there is a
match.  Alternatively, using dependency inversion, the *model* can
state what it needs from a simulator, and the simulator can use that
to decide if there is a match.

Once the intention of the model is stated, we can argue about whether
it would make sense to extend SBML to have new tags like 
"FluxFactor" in addition to  "Stoichiometry" vs. using the stated
intention of the model to affect the interpretation of a shared
tag, etc. etc.

I don't think this discussion is _really_ about float vs. int.
