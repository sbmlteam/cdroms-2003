&gt; On optional parameters

&gt; I guess we're going down this route already as
&gt; groups doing flux analysis don't require
&gt; initialAmount on specie. Then its not a major step to
&gt; make parameters optional.

Good.

&gt; The only problem is that we're taking the model
&gt; further away from what can be simulated which is
&gt; unfortunate.  This makes establishing a regime of
&gt; publishing models that simulate more problematic.
&gt; I guess we can farily easily create an additionl
&gt; stricter namespace and XML schema derived from the
&gt; main standard which forces parameter values and
&gt; initial values to be present.

We recognize that a model consists of two distinct parts: the "structure"
(equations, contraints, etc.) and the values to various parameters (that
term used loosely). Of course to do a simulation, there must be bindings
to all of the necessary values. But users need to be able to separate the
more "stable" structure from the more changable value settings.


&gt; It may not be worth getting stressed by this,
&gt; as lets face it, just having a parameter value
&gt; (and thus a simulation) doesn't tell you anything
&gt; about the correctness of the parameter value.
&gt; A missing value is just a real bad value!

I vehmently disagree. Recognizing that a value is missing is FAR more
information to the reader than a bad value. If you know you have no value,
you can stick in a bad value if you want for simulation purposes, but at
least you know what you are doing so. If you are given a value, in the
current SBML you have no clue that it is a bad value (except hopefully in
the comments). As an analogy, in the numerical analysis community, NaN
(Not a Number) is a very important entity!

&gt; A publishing regime would probably need to
&gt; have a verification step where simulation
&gt; results are compared to experimental data.

Yes, you might recall I proposed that eventually we need some sort of
definition language support for experimental data, among other things. Not
only the experimental data, but also objective functions for comparing
experimental data to simulation output should be expressable for a model.
Plenty for us to tackle later! :-)

&gt; On the parameter sets concept.
&gt;
&gt; I can imagine sets of parameters being applied
&gt; to models in much the same way as stylesheets
&gt; to xml or html data.
&gt;
&gt; There are some issues with this:
&gt;
&gt; a) should we allow incomplete parameter sets?
&gt; 	IMHO yes - it becomes a useful way to support
&gt; 	models of mutations.  We may want to allow
&gt; 	'stacks' of parameter sets to form a simulation
&gt; 	input.

We do this extensively, so support for this would be welcome.

&gt; b) does the model refer to the parameter set or visa-versa?
&gt; 	certainly from a language development
&gt; 	point of view it would be convient if
&gt; 	the parameter sets refer to the model.
&gt; 	That also appears to make sense from
&gt; 	your requirements: a model has more than
&gt; 	one parameter set and a parameter set is
&gt; 	not meaningful without a model.  But a model
&gt; 	could be considered useful without a parameter set.

Agreed.

&gt; c) I'm not keen to bring parameter sets into the publishing
&gt; 	senario at least not initially (you may disagree).  When a model
&gt; 	is published IMHO the parameters should be transferred into a
&gt; single
&gt; 	model document.  (I guess this may break down in the mutation
&gt; 	case.)  This will greatly simplify the curation process.

We certainly do use the concept of a suite of mutants, which generates an
ensemble of simulation runs.

&gt; I think we could potentially move forward by creating a
&gt; separate related standard for parameter sets that is almost
&gt; entirely independent of the model standard.  Will this work?

Yes, so long as there is a recognized link between them. Such as one
referencing the other.

&gt; On functions specifically for rate laws
&gt;
&gt; We should discuss this further with more people.
&gt; IMHO this is an issue of presentation in your
&gt; tool (but it may be common to many others)
&gt; I suggest that, for the moment at least,
&gt; you solve this by using a simple annotation.
&gt; Do you need to communicate this specific information
&gt; to other independantly coded tools?

That is probably what we will do. We can then see who else has an
interest.

&gt; On functions with variable numbers of arguments
&gt; (Mass Action)
&gt;
&gt; I think, probably needs further research,
&gt; that you're right at the edge of what MathML
&gt; supports right now.  If we want to fix this
&gt; it will take some work putting this into
&gt; the standard.  I say 'if' because a flexible
&gt; scheme for this will introduce much complexity
&gt; into the standard for perhaps little(?) pay off.
&gt; I'm not unsymphaetic to your needs its just
&gt; a question of where the big payoffs are.
&gt; Feel free to make concrete suggestions of
&gt; how the standard should be extended to tackle
&gt; this issue.

I'm not positive... but I thought MathML supports variable-length
parameter lists for functions? If so, we would solve this problem just by
including that part of MathML in the standard. This is another case where
we can see who needs it. I am hopeful we are about to see more widespread
use of SBML, and that will test a lot of assumptions.

&gt; Again you should examine if the use of
&gt; annotations could reduce the uglyness
&gt; of the current setup.

In this case, I think that is not how we will go. For now, I believe we
will simply code multiple versions of (for example) Mass Action.
