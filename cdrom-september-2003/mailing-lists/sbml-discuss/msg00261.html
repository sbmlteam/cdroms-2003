Fabien,
I don't think anyone is talking about diagrams as
an SBML equivalent to a rendered PDB entry.

What we are talking about is the layout of the network,
which in and of itself has biological and modeling
significance. For example, you could consider a
tool that does network analysis, for which the "diagram"
would be the result of its computation. So in a very
real sense, the "diagram" is one element or aspect of
a model.

Moreover, we are attempting to preserve the visual
layout of a network when it is exported from one
tool and imported into another, as a functional
matter. If a user spends an hour laying out his
diagram in the Virtual Cell, then decides to use
JDesigner to do some kind of analysis on the
model, only to find that upon importing it into
JDesigner the diagram is all messed up, they are
going to be less than pleased. We've had complaints
from users about this very issue, even on "small"
(ca. 20-30 species) models; can you imagine someone
with 500 species? They'd be pissed.

Of course, there are many extremes, from the simplest
recording of relative location (x,y) pairs, all the
way through to specifying the minutest details. How
much, or how little, should be kept--that is, how
much, or how little, could have biological or modeling
value--is up to all of us to decide; but my feeling,
and the feeling of a number of others at the Florida
meeting, was that the more possible detail one can
specify, the better--up to a limit of course. As an
example, one group uses visual cues to distinguish
between monomers, dimers, trimers, etc. So they
have a strong argument for a fairly descriptive
level of detail.

But again, we're not trying to design something that
could substitute as the rendering format for an
analogue of RasMol; we're trying to design something
that allows users to maintain the look of their
network as they move between applications.

John

PS As an aside, I'd like the language to be detailed
enough that someone could design a printing tool/
utility that took an SBML file from any of the
current tools, and print a page such that even my
first grader could identify as being a printed version
of what they see displayed on-screen in the tool.
That is, not necessarily IDENTICAL, but close enough
that you don't look at the printed page and go, "Huh?"

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I'm only half heartedly supporting SVG because there seemed
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; to be some consensus among others that it would be a good idea.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I'd rather something of our own but if the vote is to go for
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; SVG then I would of course follow the majority.
&gt; &gt; &gt;Well, it looks like whatever the consensus is for it, you,
&gt; &gt; &gt;Fabien and I aren't hot for it, preferring to do it ourselves.
&gt; 
&gt; I am afraid that I am more radical: I want to suggest an alternative
&gt; to using a subset of SVG or building anything custom to render full
&gt; details about the diagram (e.g., shapes, color, fonts) in an attempt
&gt; to design the third layer that Sven Sahle defined.
&gt; 
&gt; The alternative can be: not to embbed the rendering in SBML, but
&gt; instead to link to fully rendered diagrams (such as described in
&gt; my previous post:
&gt; <A  HREF="http://www.sbw-sbml.org/sbml-discuss/archive/msg00245.html">http://www.sbw-sbml.org/sbml-discuss/archive/msg00245.html</A>).
&gt; 
&gt; I believe that uses for high-quality, fully rendered diagrams
&gt; are not the same as for diagrams that let visualize the reactions
&gt; in a model, and interact with the species to decide what concentration
&gt; should be plotted.
&gt; 
&gt; In my opinion, these two use scenario do not overlap enough to
&gt; justify mixing these two aspects in SBML.
&gt; 
&gt; If you think differently pit would help if you could describe
&gt; use scenarios for fully rendered diagrams in the  context of
&gt; simulation/modeling.
&gt; 
&gt; Fabien
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;I'd rather focus on our specific wants and needs than sit
&gt; &gt; &gt;around arguing about what subset of SVG we can all live
&gt; &gt; &gt;with.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Agreed.
