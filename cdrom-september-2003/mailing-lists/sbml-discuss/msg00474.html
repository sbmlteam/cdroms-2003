the first place: thank you for initiating the hybrid models working
group, and my apologies for not reacting earlier (I had a to get a grant
proposal out of the way, but that's almost done now).

I think your proposal is very sensible, and I can't tear it apart at
all. You're right in assuming that hybrid modelling has not been pursued
(at least not in detail). What do you mean by "discrete" simulations, by
the way: discrete time (as in cellular automata) or discrete event (as
in stochastic sims), or both? 

Come to think about it: it might be useful (well, it would be for me) to
have a list of possible simulation types/modes/frameworks, with
examples. I suspect that this would tie in with the work of the
alternative representations group that Tom has volunteered to start up.

Getting hold of examples of biological hybrid systems is the most
important thing to do first - and I have a feeling that that is not
going to be as easy as some people think. On the other hand: doesn't
E-Cell support hybrid modelling, Takeshi? In that case you must have
examples. At Poul Nielsen's suggestion, I'll have a look at the CellML
repository - apparently there are several models in there that operate
on very different time scales (which, of course, doesn't necessarily
make them hybrid).

The other thing I would like to know about my fellow group members is
where they are 'coming from' - so that we can make use of the knowledge
that is present. For instance, I am a biochemist (turned computer
scientist in the new millennium) who has measured Kms and other
enzyme-kineticky things. When I was an experimentalist, I've needed to
do continuous (ODE) simulations, and 15 years ago we had a problem that
could only be solved by doing stochastic simulations. The program that
I've been writing over the last 2 years (NetBuilder) is a discrete time
base simulator (but it would like to become hybrid...). 

Well, that's quite long enough for now.

Cheers,

Maria

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I have not done anything on this because there have been no 
&gt; substantial replies.  How shall we proceed?

&gt; &gt; This is the promised "first email" related to the Hybrid Models 
&gt; &gt; working group.  I'd like to propose that we, as a group, 
&gt; formulate the 
&gt; &gt; initial note to go to the SBML-discuss group and propose 
&gt; having that 
&gt; &gt; done by this Monday?  Then we can carry on in that forum.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; There are three things to accomplish to send that note out:
&gt; &gt;    o proposed chair, co-chair.
&gt; &gt;    o proposed charter
&gt; &gt;    o date at which these proposals transition from proposed to 
&gt; &gt; adopted.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I would be happy to chair this.  With such a small group, I 
&gt; think that 
&gt; &gt; just means occasional call-to-arms and some secretarial work.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Here is a straw-man charter to get us started....tear it apart!

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; -----------------------------------------------
&gt; &gt; Charter of the SBML Hybrid Models Working Group
&gt; &gt; -----------------------------------------------
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Background
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Hybrid Models are those that include phenomena modeled in 
&gt; &gt; fundamentally different ways or which include elements that change 
&gt; &gt; their mode of operation, or both.  For example, discrete and 
&gt; &gt; continuous models are fundamentally different.  A model 
&gt; including both 
&gt; &gt; would be hybrid as would a system including both non-spatial 
&gt; &gt; components (represented by ODEs) and spatial components (PDE's, 
&gt; &gt; reaction-diffusion).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Mission Statement and Scope
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Except for combined continuous/discrete simulation, little hybrid 
&gt; &gt; modeling is being pursued in the SBML community [is this correct?]. 
&gt; &gt; Thus the Hybrid modeling group is at an earlier stage than 
&gt; the other 
&gt; &gt; groups and the mission statement reflects this.  Our 
&gt; mission statement
&gt; &gt; is:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;    1. Enumerate 5 sample problems ("challenges") to be 
&gt; addressed by hybrid 
&gt; &gt;       approaches.
&gt; &gt;    2. Determine what is needed from SBML to express these models.
&gt; &gt;    3. Determine what, if any, deliverable there is for the Level 3 
&gt; &gt; deadline.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Deliverables:
&gt; &gt;    -  proposal for SBML L3 extensions (this is not expected to be
&gt; &gt;       support of hybrid systems, but only support of 
&gt; limited capabilities
&gt; &gt;       like Events done with an eye toward future, fuller 
&gt; hybrid systems).
&gt; &gt;    -  challenge problems
&gt; &gt;    -  SBML requirements for Hybrid systems modeling.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; [This is not meant to be a waterfall process.  I am 
&gt; actually probing 
&gt; &gt; here to see if others feel as I do that we are at the very 
&gt; beginning. 
&gt; &gt; If so, then some time on seeing if we are all talking about 
&gt; the same 
&gt; &gt; things when we say the same words is worthwhile.  The 
&gt; requirements and 
&gt; &gt; enumeration of challenges is thus more agreement on a 
&gt; destination than 
&gt; &gt; a waterfall methodology.]

&gt; &gt; Termination criterion:
