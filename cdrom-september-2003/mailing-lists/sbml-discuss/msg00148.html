Dear all,

A lot of us have talked about the SBML development process
in the past and have tried to make it more explicit.  During
this week's SBML Forum meeting, we had some more discussions
about possible reorganizations.  The general conclusion
seems to have been that people don't want to adopt a new
structure at this time.  Instead, the consensus that emerged
at the meeting was to have people organize themselves mostly
informally into a number of special topic groups to
formulate proposals for extensions to be introduced in SBML
Level 3 or beyond.

The following is what emerged as a rough outline of a
process for these informal working groups:

1) Any interested person or group can send mail to
   sbml-discuss to propose forming a working group.  The
   announcement should include the following information:

   - A short statement of the purpose or goal of the effort
     (typically, an extension to SBML).

   - The initial contact person for the group.  That person
     may or may not be the eventual chairperson.

   - The list of the initial members of the group.

   - A description of the expected form of the outcome from
     the effort.  This will typically be a document
     describing some proposed changes to SBML.

   - An estimate of how long the group expects to stay in
     existence (meaning, how long it will give itself to
     accomplish its goals before reevaluating its status and
     expectations.)

2) Discussions within the group should, at least initially,
   take place on sbml-discuss, rather than on a separate
   mailing list.  This will avoid the need for working group
   organizer(s) to create new archived mailing lists right
   from the start, and will also allow other people to see
   some of the discussions even if they do not want to be
   involved to the level of officially being in the working
   group.  If the traffic for a particular group becomes too
   much for other people on sbml-discuss, that working group
   may create its own archived mailing list at that time.

3) Being a member of a working group implies a desire and
   willingness to work on actual software underlying the
   focus of the group's effort.  There is a general feeling
   that, from now on, proposals for SBML changes will need
   to be accompanied by examples of one or more software
   implementations of the proposed changes.  To make this
   possible, the implementations should add proposed XML
   extensions within the SBML 'annotation' element.  This
   will allow tools to exchange models with the proposed
   extensions in a semi-organized fashion.  Once the
   proposed changes have been debugged to the satisfaction
   of the group(s) using them, the proposal can be
   introduced to the SBML community at large.  When
   accepted, the new extensions will be migrated out of the
   'annotation' element and made a part of SBML.

At this past SBML Forum meeting, people formed a number of
initial working groups for different topics.  The following
is the current set of working groups and the initial contact
person who volunteered for each:

The model composition group: Martin Ginkel
The diagrams/graphical layout group: John Wagner
The arrays group: Andrew Finney
The complexes/multistate species group: Andrew Finney
The parameter sets group: Cliff Shaffer
The dynamic structures group: Eric Mjolsness
The alternative reactions group: Tom Kiehl
The spatial features group: Wayne Rindone
The hybrid group: Ed Frank
The constraints group: John Wagner
The controlled vocabularies group: Mike Hucka

The contact people above agreed to send an initial
announcement message to sbml-discuss by July 1.  These
announcement messages will include a short description of
the purpose of each group listed above.
