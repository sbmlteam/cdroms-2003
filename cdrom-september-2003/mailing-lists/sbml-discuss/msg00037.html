		     Conclusions of the
6th Workshop on Software Platforms for Systems Biology Meeting
		12th December 2002 Stockholm

We would like to begin by thanking everyone who attended the workshop
in Stockholm.  It was an exciting and successful event.

The rest of this message is a summary of the main
conclusions we believe were reached during the meeting. Attached also
are minutes of the meeting, typed up by Maria Schilstra.

============================================================
SBML Level 2
============================================================

Initial conditions
------------------
(This includes species initial concentration, compartment volume and
parameter values)

These will all be optional, with missing values implying
that the value is undefined (rather than taking on some default).
Therefore, these will not have default values assigned.


Parameter Sets
--------------

Parameter sets will be defined as a separate standard.  In
use, parameter set definitions will "point to" or reference models.
This will allow a single model to be parameterized according to many
parameter sets.

We hereby seek proposals for parameter set representations.


Use of annotation/notes (SBase derivation)
------------------------------------------
The 'annotation' and 'notes' elements will be made
applicable to 'listOf*' and 'sbml' elements.  This will
require a modification to the UML-&gt;XML Schema mapping; the exact
form of the modification has not yet been determined.


Features described in appendix of draft standard
------------------------------------------------
The attending members decided that the appendix in the draft
specification document (i.e., events, delays and default compartment
definition) should be adopted for SBML Level 2.


Controlled vocabularies for classification of rules and functions
-----------------------------------------------------------------
There was no clear consensus on this issue. (See comments below.)


Flux bounds
-----------
There was no clear consensus on this issue. (See comments below.)


"Best Practices" Document
-------------------------
People requested the development of guidelines for how SBML
is intended to be used.  Basically, the problem is that
models can be encoded in a variety of ways, and even if two tools
speak SBML, they still may not be able to use each other's models if
their "style" of encoding models is sufficiently different from each
other.  The guidelines would take the form of a document giving rules
about how to encode different classes of models and generally
describing best-practices recommendations for SBML's use.  Mike Hucka
and Andrew Finney will write it initially.  It will be reviewed in the
same way as the standard draft itself.


============================================================
SBML Level 3
============================================================

Model Composition
-----------------
The group decided to rename "modularity" to "composition",
to make it more clear that this issue deals with composing models out
of submodels, and also because "modularity" is a term used in XML
standards to refer to modular representations (e.g., see the XHTML
modularization page at
<A  HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-xhtml-m12n-schema-20021209/">http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-xhtml-m12n-schema-20021209/</A>).

Martin Ginkel will write a revised proposal for composition, hopefully
in time for discussions before the next meeting.


Encoding Stochastic Math for Reactions
--------------------------------------
A number of people need to work with stochastic models, and they have
requested a mechanism for defining the effect of reactions in a
stochastic form as opposed to the existing rate-law form used in SBML
L1 and L2.

We hereby seek proposals for how to do this.


========================================
Formalizing the SBML Development Process
========================================

Mike and Andrew proposed to make the SBML development
process more formalized, transparent, and open, and engaging more
members of the community.  As an initial step, we proposed incorporating
elements of the W3C's "Working Groups" mechanisms.  We will send a more
detailed proposal about this to the mailing lists soon.

We also want to take a moment to clarify the motivations for the process
standardization proposal, because comments at the meeting and in the
days
following it made it clear that people were left confused.

Our motivation for formalizing the SBML development process
is *not* that we intend to remove ourselves from SBML development.  We
plan on remaining involved in the development of SBML for the
foreseeable
future.  Our motivation is instead to ensure that the process is
transparent and is capable of producing standards that are useful to the
community.  We specifically do not want people to perceive SBML as being
'owned' by the SBW development group -- we want it to be a resource that
the entire community feels it owns.

We are in the process of applying for funding for our
continued involvement in the SBML development process.  We anticipate
(subject the community's approval) being founding members of any SBML
development committee that results from the process formalization step,
for an initial term, as well as providing organization, documentation
and software services as an SBML 'team' analogous to the W3C team.

=================================================
Incorporation of Controlled Vocabularies into SBML
=================================================

Several people voiced a desire that controlled vocabularies
be used to classify various types of objects in SBML; for example, for
classifying a function as a rate law or rule as a mass conservation
rule.
However, there did not appear to be a clear consensus about how to go
about doing this.

We think the following issues motivate the cautious greeting that this
proposal received:

* The features would add very limited information to a model

* Controlled vocabularies typically have the following features:
  - They are not stable and require curation

  - They require clear documentation for the classification
    system to work

  - They can become inconsistent in the large

We suggest the following:

a) Groups who wish to exchange models containing a
   controlled vocabulary should use annotations to achieve
   this.

b) These groups should document in detail the annotations
   for consideration for adoption into SBML or a related
   standard.  This will probably require demonstration of
   wide-spread need and a commitment to maintain the
   vocabulary.

c) In the longer term, we should consider creating linkages
   between SBML and separate associated standards for these
   controlled vocabularies.
