As I mentioned in the previous email I wasn't entirely sure what was the
practical side of this. Stylesheets sound like a nice idea, I'd be
interested in hearing more about this but in more concrete terms. I'm not
good at thinking very abstractly which CS people are so used to. 

The only issue I can think of is that people would have to make sure they
copy two files instead of one when passing models about, this might be a bit
of a hindrance. Perhaps a default style could be used which would be
overriden by an external file if it were found.

One other possiblity is to write translators which translate one format, eg
cellDesigner (formely SBEdit) to VCell to JDesginer at least as an intermim
measure. The stylesheet project sounds quite ambitious.

Mike,
We never dismiss your opinions as uninformed and meaningless.
Well, we do, but only behind your back. ;)
 
Seriously, though, Andrew's suggestion was worth thinking
about in detail, as you say. I guess I am having difficulty
seeing what the physical and logical parts are; it seems to
me the only logical part is the "graph layout", that is, the
nodes and edges. What the nodes look like, the colors and
fonts and borders and everything else, would be the
physical part, and the suggestion would be to handle all
that via stylesheets?
 
Also, with that approach, a tool would output an SBML file,
and an SBML-file-specific stylesheet as well. Right?
 
Also, when processing the SBML file, the importing tool
would still have to process the stylesheet-induced display
markup, yes?
 
If the answer to these two questions is "yes", then how is
that different than just sticking the physical description
inside the SBML file? I mean, we'd all still have to
agree on the allowed stylesheet markup, right?
 
John

	People,
	
	My $0.02 worth on the diagram support.
	
	I think Eric Minch focused on a critical point, also echoed
	by Andrew Finney and others, about the importance of
	separating "logical" from "physical" representations of
	diagram layouts.
	
	While admittedly I have not implemented a diagramming tool
	myself and thus some of you will dismiss my opinion as
	uninformed and meaningless, I think that given the goal of
	providing transportable diagram representations in SBML, the
	best approach is separating the logical structure of the
	diagram from physical rendering characteristics such as
	shapes, fonts, colors, etc.
	
	As Eric pointed out, this distinction has been addressed
	before.  I think it would be wise to pay attention to the
	lessons learned by others who have attempted to reach out
	beyond their specific software tools &amp; implementations and
	connect to other systems.  For example, the notion of
	stylesheets, coming most recently from HTML, makes eminent
	sense here.  It is a scalable and proven concept.  I think
	Andrew had an excellent idea, which is to push off the
	descriptions of physical characteristics to stylesheets.
	
	There is an obvious downside to this approach for those who
	have already implemented tools which use a physical
	representation approach.  This is regretful.  On the other
	hand, it is likely that no matter what approach is chosen
	for SBML, every tool will need to be modified to some
	extent, so perhaps the burden of change will not fall solely
	on one group of developers.
	
	As far as developing a logical representation for SBML, one
	approach might be to survey a subset of existing systems and
	find an intersection of common themes.  Herbert has written
	up JDesigner's diagram annotations, and there are probably
	descriptions of other systems, or at least their developers
	(the members of the DWG) could probably write brief
	summaries fairly easily.  By following Andrew's proposed
	procedure and using this survey as a starting point for
	defining the minimal graph information, it seems to me the
	DWG could make fairly rapid progress.
	
	MH
