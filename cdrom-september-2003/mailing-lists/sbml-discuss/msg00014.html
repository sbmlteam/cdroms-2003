Many thanks for your comments.
We'll discuss your requirements at Stockholm and
hopefully on this mailing list too.

On optional parameters

I guess we're going down this route already as 
groups doing flux analysis don't require
initialAmount on specie. Then its not a major step to
make parameters optional.

The only problem is that we're taking the model
further away from what can be simulated which is
unfortunate.  This makes establishing a regime of
publishing models that simulate more problematic.
I guess we can farily easily create an additionl
stricter namespace and XML schema derived from the
main standard which forces parameter values and 
initial values to be present.

It may not be worth getting stressed by this, 
as lets face it, just having a parameter value
(and thus a simulation) doesn't tell you anything
about the correctness of the parameter value.
A missing value is just a real bad value!
A publishing regime would probably need to 
have a verification step where simulation
results are compared to experimental data.

On the parameter sets concept.

I can imagine sets of parameters being applied
to models in much the same way as stylesheets
to xml or html data.

There are some issues with this:

a) should we allow incomplete parameter sets?
	IMHO yes - it becomes a useful way to support
	models of mutations.  We may want to allow
	'stacks' of parameter sets to form a simulation
	input.

b) does the model refer to the parameter set or visa-versa?
	certainly from a language development
	point of view it would be convient if 
	the parameter sets refer to the model.
	That also appears to make sense from
	your requirements: a model has more than 
	one parameter set and a parameter set is
	not meaningful without a model.  But a model
	could be considered useful without a parameter set.

c) I'm not keen to bring parameter sets into the publishing
	senario at least not initially (you may disagree).  When a model
	is published IMHO the parameters should be transferred into a
single
	model document.  (I guess this may break down in the mutation
	case.)  This will greatly simplify the curation process.

I think we could potentially move forward by creating a
separate related standard for parameter sets that is almost
entirely independent of the model standard.  Will this work?

On functions specifically for rate laws

We should discuss this further with more people.
IMHO this is an issue of presentation in your
tool (but it may be common to many others)
I suggest that, for the moment at least,
you solve this by using a simple annotation.
Do you need to communicate this specific information
to other independantly coded tools?

On functions with variable numbers of arguments
(Mass Action)
	
I think, probably needs further research,
that you're right at the edge of what MathML
supports right now.  If we want to fix this
it will take some work putting this into
the standard.  I say 'if' because a flexible
scheme for this will introduce much complexity
into the standard for perhaps little(?) pay off.
I'm not unsymphaetic to your needs its just
a question of where the big payoffs are.
Feel free to make concrete suggestions of
how the standard should be extended to tackle
this issue.
 
Again you should examine if the use of
annotations could reduce the uglyness
of the current setup.

Please comment.

yours Andrew

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Andrew -- Good to hear from you! Unfortunately, I will be
&gt; unable to attend the SBML meeting. Here are a few comments.
&gt; 
&gt; I'll mention that we are finally getting up to speed with
&gt; true use of SBML Level 2.0. Marc Vass is completing his 
&gt; translator software from the JigCell Model Builder to SBML 
&gt; Level 2.0. This means we are getting true hands-on experience 
&gt; with converting our models to SBML 2.0. So its not a 
&gt; theoretical discussion for us so much as it used to be. Note 
&gt; that by SBML 2.0, we mean support for what is in that 
&gt; appendix... we are assuming that this will be included.
&gt; 
&gt; Beyond that, this issue of initial conditions and parameter
&gt; values has certainly come up before. It will need to be 
&gt; addressed in some way. It becomes increasingly clear to us 
&gt; that the IC/Param values need to be separated from the rest 
&gt; of the model, since these vary on a more rapid development 
&gt; schedule. That is, a modeler is likely to set his equations 
&gt; and leave them, while tweaking parameter sets frequently. 
&gt; Thus, the "model" part needs to be stable while the "values" 
&gt; part changes frequently. Ideally these would be in separate 
&gt; files. The notion of include files would help a great deal 
&gt; here. It might be premature to deal with that. But as a 
&gt; stopgap, making paramter/IC values optional is good step. 
&gt; From our point of view, the idea that parameter values are a 
&gt; required part of the model is totally wrong. What happens in 
&gt; practice is that default value of (for example) zero gets 
&gt; stuck in... with the horrible result currently that one 
&gt; cannot distinguish a default placeholder (put there only 
&gt; because SBML requires it) from a value that has been 
&gt; deliberately set to zero.
&gt; 
&gt; It would be helpful to us if the named functions had some
&gt; sort of optional tag that let us distinguish rate laws from 
&gt; other types of functions. The reason is that we wish to 
&gt; display to the user of our model builder software a list of 
&gt; available ratelaws, without including other functions that 
&gt; are not meant to be used as ratelaws.
&gt; 
&gt; Finally, we do have need of variable parameter lists. The
&gt; canonical example is the mass action law, with variable 
&gt; numbers of parameters to be multiplied together. We can live 
&gt; without this for now (we have Mass Action 1, Mass Action 2, 
&gt; etc... ugly but tolerable), but it would be beneficial to get 
&gt; this supported.
