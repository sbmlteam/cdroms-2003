Many thanks for your clarifications.

I'm unclear about the way your example works.....
you gave the following:

&lt;listOfComponentInstances&gt;
  &lt;elementReference xlink:label="ref1" xlink:href="...somewhere in A" /&gt;
  &lt;elementReference xlink:label="ref2" xlink:href="...somewhere in B" /&gt;
  &lt;elementReference xlink:label="ref3" xlink:href="...somehwere in C" /&gt;

  &lt;componentInstance xlink:href="componentA.sbml"&gt;
    &lt;link xlink:from="ref2" xlink:to="ref1" /&gt;
... other links potentially ...
  &lt;/componentInstance&gt;

  &lt;componentInstance xlink:href="componentA.sbml"&gt;
    &lt;link xlink:from="ref3" xlink:to="ref1" /&gt;
... other links potentially ...
  &lt;/componentInstance&gt;
&lt;/listOfComponentInstances&gt;

I'm assuming that this means two components at the same level are linked
together.
Good I understand that but if I expand this very slightly by adding 2 B
components
I run into a problem - see arrow

&lt;listOfComponentInstances&gt;
  &lt;elementReference xlink:label="top" xlink:href=" somewhere a the top
level"/&gt;
  &lt;elementReference xlink:label="ref1" xlink:href="...somewhere in A" /&gt;
  &lt;elementReference xlink:label="ref2" xlink:href="...somewhere in B" /&gt;
  &lt;elementReference xlink:label="ref3" xlink:href="...somehwere in C" /&gt;

  &lt;componentInstance xlink:href="componentB.sbml"/&gt;
  &lt;componentInstance xlink:href="componentB.sbml"/&gt;

  &lt;componentInstance xlink:href="componentA.sbml"&gt;
    &lt;link xlink:from="ref2" xlink:to="ref1" /&gt;      &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;---- what does
ref2 refer to????
... other links potentially ...
  &lt;/componentInstance&gt;

  &lt;componentInstance xlink:href="componentA.sbml"&gt;
    &lt;link xlink:from="ref3" xlink:to="ref1" /&gt;
... other links potentially ...
  &lt;/componentInstance&gt;

 
&lt;/listOfComponentInstances&gt;

Have I missed something?   More than likely :-)

An alternative would be to recast this in the following way:

&lt;listOfComponentInstances&gt;
  &lt;elementReference xlink:label="top" xlink:href=" somewhere at the top
level only"/&gt;

  &lt;componentInstance xlink:href="componentB.sbml"&gt;
  	&lt;elementReference xlink:label="ref1" xlink:href="...somewhere in
B" /&gt;
  &lt;/componentInstance&gt;

  &lt;componentInstance xlink:href="componentB.sbml"/&gt;
  	&lt;elementReference xlink:label="ref2" xlink:href="...somewhere in
B" /&gt;
  &lt;/componentInstance&gt;

  &lt;componentInstance xlink:href="componentA.sbml"&gt;
  	&lt;elementReference xlink:label="ref3" xlink:href="...somewhere in
A" /&gt;
  &lt;/componentInstance&gt;

  &lt;componentInstance xlink:href="componentA.sbml"&gt;
  	&lt;elementReference xlink:label="ref4" xlink:href="...somewhere in
A" /&gt;
  &lt;/componentInstance&gt;

  &lt;link xlink:from="ref1" xlink:to="ref3" /&gt;
  &lt;link xlink:from="ref2" xlink:to="ref4" /&gt;
  &lt;link xlink:from="ref2" xlink:to="top" /&gt;

&lt;/listOfComponentInstances&gt;

Is this any better or worse?

you wrote:

&gt; &gt; a) XPATH can only refer to concrete XML structures.  
&gt; Structures that 
&gt; &gt; are inferred by SBML - in the future - such as the inside of a 
&gt; &gt; specific model instance can't be referred
&gt; &gt; to (if you allow any number of instances of the same sub-model).  I
&gt; &gt; guess it can be done by
&gt; &gt; a pair of XPATHs one to the instance and the other to inside the
&gt; &gt; sub-model.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't think I understand what you mean with this.  Could 
&gt; you give me an example?
&gt; 

OK, using the scheme I outlined above...

consider the inside of B:
...
&lt;listOfComponentInstances&gt;
  &lt;componentInstance xlink:href="componentC.sbml"&gt;
  	&lt;elementReference xlink:label="ref1" xlink:href="...somewhere in
C" /&gt;
  &lt;/componentInstance&gt;

  &lt;componentInstance xlink:href="componentC.sbml"/&gt;
  	&lt;elementReference xlink:label="ref2" xlink:href="...somewhere in
C" /&gt;
  &lt;/componentInstance&gt;

  &lt;link xlink:from="ref1" xlink:to="ref2" /&gt;
&lt;/listOfComponentInstances&gt;
...

now the top level:

&lt;listOfComponentInstances&gt;
  &lt;componentInstance xlink:href="componentB.sbml"&gt;
  	&lt;elementReference xlink:label="ref1" xlink:href="...somewhere
inside the first C inside B" /&gt; 
 	&lt;elementReference xlink:label="ref2" xlink:href="...somewhere
inside the 2nd C inside B" /&gt;
  &lt;/componentInstance&gt;

  &lt;componentInstance xlink:href="componentA.sbml"&gt;
  	&lt;elementReference xlink:label="ref3" xlink:href="...somewhere in
A" /&gt;
  &lt;/componentInstance&gt;

  &lt;link xlink:from="ref1" xlink:to="ref3" /&gt;
  &lt;link xlink:from="ref2" xlink:to="ref3" /&gt;

&lt;/listOfComponentInstances&gt;

Now I don't see how you write the XPATH to do 
xlink:href="...somewhere inside the first C inside B" 

I believe you can do this in a single XPATH reference:
you have to have one XPATH which refers to the instance and then
an XPATH that refers to the element inside the instance.

This is not a showstopper.
The real question is: Do we care?

Note: ideally instances should have a optional(?) id field so that its
possible to refer
them directly without using XPATH indexing.

I still like the general scheme.

&gt; &gt; b) these standards work fine if you use them in combination 
&gt; with the 
&gt; &gt; 'source' data structures. You can apply them to DOM representations 
&gt; &gt; easily.  However you're operating on your
&gt; &gt; own non-DOM representation you have write you're own parser - XPATH
&gt; &gt; isn't XML! :-(
&gt; 
&gt; I think people should be using DOM, SAX, etc... rather than 
&gt; rolling their own parsers.  The additional constraints for 
&gt; SBML model checking should be written on top of those APIs.
&gt; 

I agree.
If you use SAX event interface the result is not a DOM structure but
your own structures.
Then if you wish to navigate using XPATH you probably have to interpret
the XPATH
yourself, I suspect, since XPATH interpreters will operate on DOMs only.
Perhaps I'm conjecturing too much.

&gt; &gt; Many developers prefer to parse direct to custom structures.  Are 
&gt; &gt; there parsers for XPATH?
&gt; 
&gt; I've started looking at this some.  There are a number of 
&gt; XPath processors out there, Xindice being one I have some 
&gt; familiarity with although it's not strictly a XPath 
&gt; processor.  I've not yet seen any I would consider useful 
&gt; components.  That said, the grammar for XPath is not terribly 
&gt; complex and writing a *CC style representation doesn't strike 
&gt; me as difficult.  I've seen references to grammars suitable 
&gt; for parser generators but haven't tried to track one down yet.
&gt; 
I agree.  I don't think this is an argument against XPATH but
once developers go down this path then the benefits of reusing XPATH
might be diminished (?)

Is your motivation of using XLINK to use generic XLINK savvy programs to
read SBML directly?
If yes what are the benefits?

yours

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I would add that composition of models implies a hierarchical 
&gt; &gt; structure. Are you implying that composition should 
&gt; restricted to one 
&gt; &gt; level?
&gt; 
&gt; There is certainly a hierarchy of composition.  I think there 
&gt; are multiple kinds of hierarchy a user may want to impose on 
&gt; a model. Composition is a particular kind of hierarchy and, 
&gt; of necessity, a fairly rigid one.  By this I mean you are 
&gt; forced to construct the hierarchy following the structure of 
&gt; components.  If you change the hierarchy, you've either 
&gt; changed the model or you've changed the content of one or 
&gt; more components.  Users may wish to use hierarchy as a 
&gt; structuring mechanism for presentation purposes without 
&gt; altering the definition of the model.
&gt; 
&gt; I do not mean to imply composition is limited to a single 
&gt; level. Any given model or component may reference other 
&gt; models as components. The depth of nesting is not bounded by 
&gt; the design of the composition mechanism.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I'm a bit confused as to how you would compose 2 instances 
&gt; of the same 
&gt; &gt; sub-model in your scheme.  Do you have an example?
&gt; 
&gt; Roughly as follows:
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;listOfComponentInstances&gt;
&gt;   &lt;elementReference xlink:label="ref1" 
&gt; xlink:href="...somewhere in A" /&gt;
&gt;   &lt;elementReference xlink:label="ref2" 
&gt; xlink:href="...somewhere in B" /&gt;
&gt;   &lt;elementReference xlink:label="ref3" 
&gt; xlink:href="...somehwere in C" /&gt;
&gt; 
&gt;   &lt;componentInstance xlink:href="componentA.sbml"&gt;
&gt;     &lt;link xlink:from="ref2" xlink:to="ref1" /&gt;
&gt; ... other links potentially ...
&gt;   &lt;/componentInstance&gt;
&gt; 
&gt;   &lt;componentInstance xlink:href="componentA.sbml"&gt;
&gt;     &lt;link xlink:from="ref3" xlink:to="ref1" /&gt;
&gt; ... other links potentially ...
&gt;   &lt;/componentInstance&gt;
&gt; &lt;/listOfComponentInstances&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Each occurance of a componentInstance element defines a new 
&gt; occurance of a component, a copy if you will.  Each instance 
&gt; has an implied, distinct name space in the composed model, 
&gt; part of the encapsulation model.  This needs to be developed 
&gt; in more detail in one of the missing sections but what I have 
&gt; in mind is the usual symbol renaming approach a-la free 
&gt; variable renaming in proof theories.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I believe we need to work towards a model composition standard with 
&gt; &gt; the following features:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; a) Interfaces
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I think we can use defined interfaces.  In fact in some 
&gt; contexts they 
&gt; &gt; will be very useful for example they will guide users to those 
&gt; &gt; elements that the sub-model author
&gt; &gt; thought were appropriate places to link to other models.
&gt; 
&gt; I view interface definition as a documentation issue in the 
&gt; development of a component.  I argue in the presentation we 
&gt; can't do type checking, one of the main things you get from 
&gt; the definition of interfaces.  Without a meaningful notion of 
&gt; type, I would argue you can't systematically represent the 
&gt; meaning of a model as anything more than an organized 
&gt; collection of labels, useful but very difficult to analyze.  
&gt; It is incumbent on the developer of a model to provide useful 
&gt; documentation about the structure and use of a component.  
&gt; This includes such things as selecting the set of labels to 
&gt; be meaningful in the context of the application.  There is 
&gt; nothing preventing a model developer from assigning labels A, 
&gt; B, C, ... to species elements when they in fact represent 
&gt; known compounds like a calcium ion, a phosphate group, atomic 
&gt; oxygen, ...
&gt; 
&gt; Similarly, it is incumbent upon the user of a component to 
&gt; understand the intent and structure of the component.  
&gt; Writing good components in a modelling language is and always 
&gt; will be difficult.  A user must evaluate whether a given 
&gt; _implementation_ of a component is indeed suitable for use in 
&gt; a particular application.
&gt; 
&gt; Having said we can't do type checking, I will say there are 
&gt; some things we can check which are types at the level of 
&gt; SBML/XML.  These fall in the category of reference 
&gt; consistency for various attributes.  For example, a species 
&gt; reference in a reaction must refer to a species label.  There 
&gt; are similar kinds of checks one can make with the composition 
&gt; model and these will need to be enumerated; notionally, they 
&gt; are part of the definition of the combined model, yet another 
&gt; of the missing sections.  An example of what I have in mind 
&gt; here is you can't link a species element to anything other 
&gt; than a species element, an example you mention later in your message.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Interfaces
&gt; &gt; enable two sub-models
&gt; &gt; to be composed graphically without the whole of the 
&gt; sub-models being 
&gt; &gt; visible.
&gt; 
&gt; I view this use of an interface defintion as being the 
&gt; responsibility of a model editor.  We may wish to provide 
&gt; specific elements in SBML to identify these attributes of a 
&gt; model but I would argue they are in no way part of the 
&gt; _definition_ of the composed model.  I consider them to be 
&gt; analogous to graph layout information.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; A user can chose whether interfaces
&gt; &gt; should be respected or not.  I think we can do some useful link 
&gt; &gt; checking without labels e.g. making sure that elements of different 
&gt; &gt; types aren't linked e.g. species to compartment
&gt; &gt; in addition parameter units can be checked e.g. block a 
&gt; volts parameter
&gt; &gt; being connected to a
&gt; &gt; moles parameter.  In fact this was a motivation behind units.
&gt; 
&gt; Again, more detail is needed on the combined form of a 
&gt; composed model. One of those details is the constraints on 
&gt; link targets and a set of rules needs to be developed.
&gt; 
&gt; As an aside, I'm not sure I agree with your example about 
&gt; substituting "volts" for "moles" - consider the case where a 
&gt; user is building a model representing an experiment.  
&gt; Concentration may be measured as a voltage.  Is it a _good_ 
&gt; idea to mix the 2 concepts without an appropriate conversion 
&gt; term?  Proabably not.  Should we actually specify it to not 
&gt; be possible?  Again, I would argue no since I see this as an 
&gt; issue of model quality rather than correctness.  It might be 
&gt; a suitable rule for a lint-like application but I would 
&gt; contend it's probably not something to specify for the 
&gt; definition of the language.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; b) Alternative model 'implementations'
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It would be very useful to have alternative submodel 
&gt; "implementations" 
&gt; &gt; for the same subsystem. Alternative sub-models can model at 
&gt; different 
&gt; &gt; levels of details and/or use different math
&gt; &gt; representations.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The main problem with this is providing a labeling mechanism that 
&gt; &gt; would allow users to select the set of sub-models that should be 
&gt; &gt; applied to a given tool. This implies
&gt; &gt; a kind of ontology that's either public or private to just 
&gt; a given set
&gt; &gt; of models.
&gt; 
&gt; I'll presume you mean something analogous to conditional 
&gt; compilation here and hope you'll elaborate if I've missed 
&gt; your point.  Also, I view this as somewhat orthogonal to the 
&gt; definition of components due, at least in part, to my 
&gt; opinions about how these capabilities should be addressed.
&gt; 
&gt; The goal is to allow information from the usage environment 
&gt; to have an impact on the definition of the model.  The 
&gt; obvious mechanism is a conditional like the #ifdef macros in 
&gt; the C preprocessor.  My experience with C is this becomes a 
&gt; maintenance nightmare very quickly.  You get combinatoric 
&gt; explosion of feature combinations very quickly and the code 
&gt; becomes very bulky and difficult to understand.  I believe 
&gt; some combination of XSLT conditional elements and parameters 
&gt; would be a suitable implementation for this type of 
&gt; functionality.  I don't think any changes are required in 
&gt; SBML with this approach.
&gt; 
&gt; I would argue this specific example is a minor variant of the 
&gt; notion of model families,  a collection of implementations of 
&gt; related models where the "bulk" of a model is the same and 
&gt; selected variants are made. XML documents are structured data 
&gt; streams suitable for inclusion in databases.  With the 
&gt; understanding I am not really a user, I want to store models 
&gt; in a database and my component library is a real database 
&gt; rather than a simple file.  As such, I would construct 
&gt; variants using something like XUpdate, see 
&gt; <A  HREF="http://www.xmldb.org/xupdate/">http://www.xmldb.org/xupdate/</A> for its defintion and 
&gt; <A  HREF="http://xml.apache.org/xindice/">http://xml.apache.org/xindice/</A> for a particular 
&gt; implementation.  Each variant would somehow have a set of 
&gt; attributes describing its criteria for selection, my 
&gt; preference here would be an RDF based, or similar, attribute 
&gt; model.  Whether the attribute descriptions for a variant are 
&gt; just part of the model metadata or if they need some special 
&gt; standing in the defintion of SBML is something I haven't 
&gt; worked out yet.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not sure I understand your comment about an ontology.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; c) overloading
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; You wondered how we would resolve the attributes of linked 
&gt; elements. 
&gt; &gt; There are 3 possible complementary mechanisms:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; i) abstraction - allow some attributes to be undefined/missing 
&gt; &gt; (typically this needs to be restricted to just those 
&gt; elements on the 
&gt; &gt; interface of a model).  some attributes are already 
&gt; optional in SBML.
&gt; &gt; A missing attribute value is then overloaded by a 'concrete' element
&gt; &gt; which has an attribute value.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; ii) hierarchical overloading - an attribute value from a 
&gt; higher level 
&gt; &gt; overloads a lower level attribute value.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; iii) directed linking - label one end of a link as being an 
&gt; overloader 
&gt; &gt; that supplies the attribute value.
&gt; 
&gt; I think this is a case of my not making a very effective 
&gt; presentation. What I have in mind is a combination of the 3 
&gt; of your mechanisms. Starting with (iii), links are directed 
&gt; with the "xlink:from" attribute of a link element defining 
&gt; the parent and the "xlink:to" attribute defining the child.  
&gt; The final value of an attribute in the composed model is (ii) 
&gt; followed by (i).  In words, look for the attribute in the 
&gt; parent.  If it's not defined, look for it in the child.  
&gt; Recurse if there are multiple levels to the definition of the 
&gt; element (e.g. the child target of a link in a component could 
&gt; itself be the parent of a link in the definition of the component).
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; (... the problems with XPath etc... are)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; a) XPATH can only refer to concrete XML structures.  
&gt; Structures that 
&gt; &gt; are inferred by SBML - in the future - such as the inside of a 
&gt; &gt; specific model instance can't be referred
&gt; &gt; to (if you allow any number of instances of the same sub-model).  I
&gt; &gt; guess it can be done by
&gt; &gt; a pair of XPATHs one to the instance and the other to inside the
&gt; &gt; sub-model.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't think I understand what you mean with this.  Could 
&gt; you give me an example?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; b) these standards work fine if you use them in combination 
&gt; with the 
&gt; &gt; 'source' data structures. You can apply them to DOM representations 
&gt; &gt; easily.  However you're operating on your
&gt; &gt; own non-DOM representation you have write you're own parser - XPATH
&gt; &gt; isn't XML! :-(
&gt; 
&gt; I think people should be using DOM, SAX, etc... rather than 
&gt; rolling their own parsers.  The additional constraints for 
&gt; SBML model checking should be written on top of those APIs.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Many developers prefer to parse direct to custom structures.  Are 
&gt; &gt; there parsers for XPATH?
&gt; 
&gt; I've started looking at this some.  There are a number of 
&gt; XPath processors out there, Xindice being one I have some 
&gt; familiarity with although it's not strictly a XPath 
&gt; processor.  I've not yet seen any I would consider useful 
&gt; components.  That said, the grammar for XPath is not terribly 
&gt; complex and writing a *CC style representation doesn't strike 
&gt; me as difficult.  I've seen references to grammars suitable 
&gt; for parser generators but haven't tried to track one down yet.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; c) these standards can be unconstrained - for example you can write 
&gt; &gt; references to ranges of elements in contexts where this is 
&gt; meaningless 
&gt; &gt; - this might require some complexity for a
&gt; &gt; validator.  A custom format based on XML might well make 
&gt; this impossible
&gt; &gt; at the syntactic level.
&gt; 
&gt; My general preference is to let users have as much rope as 
&gt; they want. Next, XML is a poor choice as a representation for 
&gt; enforcing syntactic checks and SBML, being an XML 
&gt; application, inherits this.  A validator will always work 
&gt; with a specific model instance and should be constructed to 
&gt; resolve linked elements.  I think once you have the result of 
&gt; the XPath expression in the link element, the validation is 
&gt; not much different than checking an interface definition or 
&gt; many of the other constraints SBML imposes over and above 
&gt; those possible to specify in a XSchema definition.
