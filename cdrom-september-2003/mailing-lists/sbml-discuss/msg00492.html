&gt;Getting hold of examples of biological hybrid systems is the most
&gt;important thing to do first - and I have a feeling that that is not
&gt;going to be as easy as some people think. On the other hand: doesn't
&gt;E-Cell support hybrid modelling, Takeshi? In that case you must have
&gt;examples. At Poul Nielsen's suggestion, I'll have a look at the CellML
&gt;repository - apparently there are several models in there that operate
&gt;on very different time scales (which, of course, doesn't necessarily
&gt;make them hybrid).
&gt;
Examples from the Alur et al paper:
-- Inhibtor proteins turning off gene transcription by RNA polymerase
-- eukaryotic cell  division is a sequence of four processes, each with 
continuous dynamics
-- cell differentiation
-- Bioluminescence in E fischeri

Examples from the Bockmayr-Courtois paper:
-- cell differentiation for X laevis cells (Delta-Notch signalling)

&gt;The other thing I would like to know about my fellow group members is
&gt;where they are 'coming from' - so that we can make use of the knowledge
&gt;that is present. For instance, I am a biochemist (turned computer
&gt;scientist in the new millennium) who has measured Kms and other
&gt;enzyme-kineticky things. When I was an experimentalist, I've needed to
&gt;do continuous (ODE) simulations, and 15 years ago we had a problem that
&gt;could only be solved by doing stochastic simulations. The program that
&gt;I've been writing over the last 2 years (NetBuilder) is a discrete time
&gt;base simulator (but it would like to become hybrid...). 
&gt;  
&gt;
Recapping my introduction from the workshop: My main interests are in 
programming languages and models, particularly declarative languages 
that can be used to model aspects of the physical, biological and 
artificial worlds (re: Herb Simon's artificial sciences). I work in 
foundations, and build real systems and applications based on these 
foundations. My collaborators and I introduced in the late 80s a new 
theory of concurrency and communication (a generalization of concurrent 
logic programming and constraint logic programming), called concurrent 
constraint programming. A primary reference to this is my thesis:

Vijay Saraswat, Concurrent Constraint Programming, MIT Press Doctoral 
Dissertation Award and Logic Programming Series, 1993.

This remains the most general theory of determinate concurrency in 
computer science, encompassing other theories such as data-flow and lazy 
functional programming. It has also been extended to non-deterministic 
systems in a variety of ways, and is capable of handling "mobility", as 
in the pi-calculus. (This aspect of the pi-calculus was used by Regev, 
Silverman and Shapiro in their paper in 2000 "Representation and 
simulation of biochemical processes using the pi-calculus process 
algebra".) Since then dozens of authors have written scores of papers on 
this topic -- check <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.citeseer.org">www.citeseer.org</a> for "Concurrent Constraint 
Programming" for example.

We extended this to discrete timed systems and hybrid systems in the mid 
90s motivated primarily by the challenge to use this framework to model 
engineered artifacts. The relevant journal papers are:

(*) Vijay Saraswat, Radha Jagadeesan and Vineet Gupta  ``Timed Default 
Concurrent Constraint Programming'', In Journal of  Symbolic Computation 
22 (5,6) 475--520, 1996. Extended abstract published in the Proceedings 
of the ACM Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages, San 
Fransisco, 1995.

(*) Vineet Gupta, Radha Jagadeesan and Vijay Saraswat ``Computing with 
Continuous Change'',  Science of Computer Programming, 30 (1:2) 3-49, 1998.

The key points about HCC, relevant for our work on hybrid modeling in 
systems biology, are:  (0) it is built on very few (five) primitive 
operations, and is hence very easy to understand (1) it has a built-in 
notion of continuous time, (2) it supports smooth and discontinuous 
system evolution, (3) it supports stochastic modeling, (4) it provides a 
powerful, extensible constraint solver, (5) it supports qualitative and 
quantitative representations, (6) it can already handle variable 
structure systems, (7) it is built on a formal operational and 
denotational semantics (and can hence support mathematical analysis).

Vineet led the development of the first HCC implementation in the mid 
90s. This is described in:

(*) Bjorn Carlson and Vineet Gupta "Hybrid cc with Interval 
Constraints", HSCC pp 80-95, 1998.

(This is the system that was used by Bockmayr and Courtois in their 
paper on systems biology.)

*These papers are available off the jcc home page 
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.cse.psu.edu/~saraswat/jcc">http://www.cse.psu.edu/~saraswat/jcc</a>

We are currently in the middle of a second generation implementation 
effort within Java, called jcc. In addition to the above features of 
Hcc, jcc is completely integrated with Java, and supports 
meta-programming (the dynamic generation of models/programs).

A paper describing the discrete time programming language extending Java 
is available from my home page <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.cse.psu.edu/~saraswat">http://www.cse.psu.edu/~saraswat</a>

Vijay Saraswat, Radha Jagadeesan and Vineet Gupta "jcc: Integrating 
Timed Default Concurrent Constraint Programming into Java", submitted 
for publication.

Later this summer we expect to have jcc augmented with a constraint 
system as rich as the one implemented in the first version of the 
language. We intend to use it for various systems biology applications. 
In particular, if it makes sense, we will write a front-end which 
accepts SBML and CellML models. Our goal with jcc is not just to 
simulate (i.e. execute) the programs, but also do symbolic analysis, 
e.g. through model-checking (as done, in the context of systems biology 
by, e.g. Lincoln and Tiwari). (This program is being called symbolic 
systems biology by some of our colleagues.)

Best,
Vijay
