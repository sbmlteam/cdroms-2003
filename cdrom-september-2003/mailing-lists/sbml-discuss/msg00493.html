Hi Vijay,


&gt; I would be quite interested in whether the theory of this book can 
&gt; usefully characterize the other sys biology systems currently being built.

I don't have a clear answer to this, because I didn't explore the possibility of
adopting his DEVS theory itself to cell biology simulation.    
(A funny story actually is that I re-invented 'a sort of' discrete event simulation
 scheme two years ago, without knowing there are efforts to extend it for
 'hybrid' simulation.   I happened to know that some months later..  :)
 
But I think there are some works ongoing for systems biology.
I remember I saw a poster that uses Zeigler's DEVS for T-cell response analysis
in the previous ICSB.   I think it is still on the web.. maybe this one:
<A  HREF="http://www.ki.se/icsb2002/pdf/ICSB_88-89.pdf">http://www.ki.se/icsb2002/pdf/ICSB_88-89.pdf</A>
Seems like they treat discrete state transitions, but it is stochastic.


You may better understand the whole picture than me on this sort of things.


regards,
-Kouichi


&gt; I have followed the book a little bit. This is certainly in the 
&gt; framework of "Hybrid Systems" that combine discrete and continuous 
&gt; system evolution. It should certainly be considered seriously.
&gt; 
&gt; I do not have an overall assessment of the work yet; the parts that I 
&gt; have seen (e.g. the definition of DEVS in Chapter 4) do not seem very 
&gt; encouraging. I dont think there are structural problems with their work 
&gt; -- its just that a lot of obvious material takes up a lot of pages 
&gt; (thats just a matter of opinion and taste). A number of critical issues 
&gt; have been glossed over (at least in Chapter 4) --- e.g. are infinite 
&gt; sequences of instantaneous transitions allowed? (Ah, I see this is 
&gt; convered in Chapter 6.2.3, p 141). Why are DEVS not required to be 
&gt; effectively given ...e.g. the state transition function is defined over 
&gt; an uncountable set!?  What happens when an external event occurs at the 
&gt; very same time as an internal transition (ah -- I see.. on page 90 they 
&gt; introduce a "confluent" transition to handle this problem..this is 
&gt; messy!!)?  Why does the system output a value only when it undergoes an 
&gt; internal transition? Combined with the possibility that there can be an 
&gt; infinite sequence of instantaneous transitions, we have the possibility 
&gt; of infinite instantaneous output!?! Why are there no continuously 
&gt; changing state variables -- e.g. as defined by differential 
&gt; equations?(Ah, looking ahead I see this shows up in Chapter  In fact 
&gt; this implies that there is no notion of transitions because of state 
&gt; variables reaching a threshold!  Why does the coupling version (P 86) 
&gt; not allow feedback loops? The coupled definition is just plain messy 
&gt; (and also sloppy! Where is X_p defined? is p a port? How is X_p related 
&gt; to X_d?) Where is the semantics of the select function defined? The 
&gt; distinction between the parallel and non-parallel version seems just 
&gt; plain messy.
&gt; 
&gt; (The book does not appear to have been proof-read well. Chapter 6 is 
&gt; missing the bibliography ("Sources") even though it has citations. 
&gt; Another definite drawback of this book is a lack of realistic examples. 
&gt; Most examples are quite abstract and mathematical, instead of being 
&gt; drawn from concrete engineering experience, say, which would also 
&gt; highlight the connection with real systems analysis and modeling. The 
&gt; lack of a specific *language* for defining systems is a definite drawback.)
&gt; 
&gt; Now it is quite possibly that some of these limitations are removed in 
&gt; subsequent chapters (indeed, skipping ahead, it appears that they 
&gt; are...). But this points to a problem with the spiral pedagogical style 
&gt; of this book (from a researcher's point of view, as opposed to a 
&gt; student)... one has to go look at the whole book to get an idea of their 
&gt; overall system, as opposed to say, a chapter, where the system is 
&gt; formally defined, its theoretical properties collected etc etc. Anyway, 
&gt; that is just to say that for me to understand their theoretical model is 
&gt; going to take some time. If anyone else has already worked out the 
&gt; answers to the questions above, I would be much obliged if they can 
&gt; enlighten me/us.
&gt; 
&gt; To relate HCC to the terms introduced in this book, HCC is actually a 
&gt; *language* (built from a very few primitives) that can be used for 
&gt; modular "multicomponent differential equation systems specifications" 
&gt; (Chapter 7.6, page 169). However, HCC is built on logic and constraints, 
&gt; rather than on "systems theory", so the mappings are not that clear (at 
&gt; least at first shot). A lot of the distinctions introduced in the book 
&gt; do not seem to be relevant in the case of HCC -- for instance,  input 
&gt; and output are symmetric in HCC (both correspond to imposition of 
&gt; constraints); there is no separation between internal and external 
&gt; transitions. HCC is already closed under parallel composition 
&gt; (conjunction), so there is no need for a distinction between "parallel 
&gt; DEVS" and "classical DEVS".  Systems can be "multicomponent" and 
&gt; "networked" -- this is just another way of saying that they are closed 
&gt; under parallel composition (that is, a parallel composition of systems 
&gt; is just another system, hence this operation can be iterated repeatedly 
&gt; to obtain a hierarchically defined system).
&gt; 
&gt; I would be quite interested in whether the theory of this book can 
&gt; usefully characterize the other sys biology systems currently being built.
&gt; 
&gt; For the relevance of hybrid systems to systems biology, I would still 
&gt; recommend the three papers I cited in an earlier message rather than 
&gt; this book.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;time being I'll assume that Zeigler et al. have done a good analysis of
&gt; &gt;the process of modelling &amp; simulation, and use what I've learned from
&gt; &gt;the book so far.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;To get back to your email, Ed, Zeigler et al. distinguish 3 types
&gt; &gt;(formalisms) of dynamic model specification (as opposed to e.g. object
&gt; &gt;modelling, in which there is no concept of time): the Discrete Time
&gt; &gt;
&gt; This is a glaring bunder in the first five pages of this book, which can 
&gt; do much harm to readers who may not know better. The whole area of 
&gt; synchronous programming is about computation with a built-in notion of 
&gt; time (discrete and continuous).
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;(DTSS), Differential Equation (DESS), and Discrete Event (DEVS) System
&gt; &gt;Specifications. DESS includes ODE and PDE descriptions. DTSS includes
&gt; &gt;things such as cellular automata (which are updated as a whole in a unit
&gt; &gt;'time' step). I think (but I'm not entirely sure) that DEVS includes
&gt; &gt;stochastic models (in which possible state transitions have certain
&gt; &gt;probabilities), but also threshold models (in which a state transition
&gt; &gt;occurs when a certain parameter crosses a given threshold). Have I
&gt; &gt;understood this correctly?
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt;
&gt;  DEVS at least as in Chpater 4 do not appear to include stochastic 
&gt; models or "threshold" models.
&gt;
