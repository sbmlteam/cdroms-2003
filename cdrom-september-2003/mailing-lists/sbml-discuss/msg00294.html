&gt;        Using someone else's fully rendered diagrams doesn't cut it. I
&gt;want to be able to show fluxes as thicker/thinner lines at various time
&gt;points in a model. For this I need to be able to render the diagrams
&gt;myself. There's also the problem of being able to alter the model easily
&gt;by adding just one more inhibitor/promoter/inducer/repressor/etc. A tool
&gt;that does the rendering should alow us to edit existing diagrams (and
&gt;models) easily. One that uses someone else's bitmap means starting from
&gt;scratch. Or maybe everyone else creates perfect models first time?

I agree with you here, but remember the SBML spec is only a transportable
format it does not stippulate (it had better not anyway) how you can further
elaborate the graphics in your own application or what you wanty to do with
your applciation. For example, I colour code reactions according to the
results from metatool, if colour wasn't an attribute in the SBML I'd still
use colours in the appplication.

Hi,

I liked the forum (a lot more manageable than email for me), but since
it has been dropped, I am reposting this below.

<A  HREF="http://caboy.uchc.edu/SBML/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=3">http://caboy.uchc.edu/SBML/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=3</A>

Let me know if you find this document useful, I am experimenting
to see if this pattern can help clarify the discussions on the list.

Fabien

I tried here to summarize the objective and constraints of the diagram
extensions. This will help me (and hopefully others) understand what the
issues are. We can then reference the goals, constraints and issues in
subsequent discussions. I believe that if we agree on goals, constraints
and use scenarios, the design of the extensions will be a lot easier,
because we will all be speaking about the same thing.

Goal:
------
1. Provide a mechanism so that layouts created in one modeling
environment
can be used in another modeling in a relatively straightforward manner.
We
want to avoid users moving graphical elements around every time they
import an SBML model in a target environment.

Typical Use Scenario:
---------------------
1. Creating a model in JDesigner, exporting to SBML, importing into
VCell.
[layout is built interactively by the modeler using JDesigner.]
2. Exporting an SBML model from SigPath, importing in Vcell or
JDesigner.
[the layout is automatically generated.]


Constraint(s):
--------------

1. Avoid using information about how the graphical elements of the
diagram
will be rendered (support layered approach suggested by Sven Shale on
smbl-discuss. This constraint is applicable to the second layer.)

2. Minimize impact on existing SBML-aware software. Rationale: The
extension is unlikely to be implemented (and therefore used) if it
requires costly software adaptations and tests of the new behavior.

Current issues:
-----------------

1. Should we specify units for positions of graphical elements of the
diagram on the page? (Herbert Sauro)

2. Should we be forcing font faces, font sizes, colours, or shapes for
types of molecules on users (Hugh Spence), i.e., as an implicit
convention
across the entire set of possible SBML files, so that each tool knows
exactly what to expect in terms of font size and can render the same
layout as all the other tools will. (Fabien Campagne, I rephrased the
last
part of the sentence, I hope both mean the same, otherwise, please
elaborate).

3. There seems to be an extension proposed by the European Media
Laboratory in circulation. Where can I read the proposal? (Fabien
Campagne).
