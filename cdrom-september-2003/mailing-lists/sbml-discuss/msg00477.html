Hi Ed + others,

I have a book in front of me called "Theory of Modeling and Simulation"
2nd ed., by Zeigler, Praehofer &amp; Kim. I remember listening to a talk on
E-cell (can't remember whether it was given by Takeshi), in which this
book was cited as the 'basis' for E-cell - is that so, Takeshi? It seems
to me that the theory presented in this book is just what we need for
our purposes, but since I'm by no means an expert in this area, there
may be competing theories. Does Vijay have an opinion on this? For the
time being I'll assume that Zeigler et al. have done a good analysis of
the process of modelling &amp; simulation, and use what I've learned from
the book so far.

To get back to your email, Ed, Zeigler et al. distinguish 3 types
(formalisms) of dynamic model specification (as opposed to e.g. object
modelling, in which there is no concept of time): the Discrete Time
(DTSS), Differential Equation (DESS), and Discrete Event (DEVS) System
Specifications. DESS includes ODE and PDE descriptions. DTSS includes
things such as cellular automata (which are updated as a whole in a unit
'time' step). I think (but I'm not entirely sure) that DEVS includes
stochastic models (in which possible state transitions have certain
probabilities), but also threshold models (in which a state transition
occurs when a certain parameter crosses a given threshold). Have I
understood this correctly?

&gt; Would the following modifications to the charter incorporate 
&gt; your comments fully:
&gt;   1. elaborate "discrete" in the example text

I don't think you need to elaborate discrete (in the introduction) any
further, as you're using it in a very general way, but maybe you could
leave out the "Except for combined continuous/discrete simulation" bit,
because even that sounds too grand in the light of what people are
currently doing (to my knowledge). 

&gt;   2. Add before "enumerate 5 models," "enumerate simulation 
&gt; types/modes/frameworks"

Yes, I think that would be a good idea (btw, when you say 'enumerate',
do you mean 'list', or does enumerate have any further significance
(like: we need to give each one a number)?). Maybe "list modelling
formalisms" expresses more precisely what we're going to talk about than
"simulation types/modes/frameworks"?

&gt;   3. Add as a deliverable, refinment of terminology/concepts.

Agreed. Very necessary.

&gt; ps. Although this thread is outside the SBW discuss mailing 
&gt; list, I'd like to see us collect this thread and post it to 
&gt; the list once we've agreed on the proto-type charter.  Would 
&gt; that be ok?  Then people will see the history and join in on 
&gt; refining the charter.
&gt; 

Yes, that's a good idea - we keep it between ourselves until we agree
what it is we're talking about, but after that give people the
opportunity to check our arguments. By that time we need to ask everyone
on the list whether they can give us examples. I can think of several
systems that would 'benefit from' hybrid modelling, but working out
those things are whole projects in themselves, and it would be necessary
to apply for funding to carry them out. (Btw: I'm open to that: my
contract runs out by the end of the year).

Well, enough again,

Cheers,

Maria

&gt; 
&gt; Hi Maria,
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you for the note.  In answer to your question, "yes," 
&gt; i.e., "yes, I am not sure which discrete I meant" AND, "yes, 
&gt; _both._" It is all part and parcel of enumerating simulation 
&gt; types and clarifying terminology.
&gt; 
&gt; Would the following modifications to the charter incorporate 
&gt; your comments fully:
&gt;   1. elaborate "discrete" in the example text
&gt;   2. Add before "enumerate 5 models," "enumerate simulation 
&gt; types/modes/
&gt;      frameworks"
&gt;   3. Add as a deliverable, refinment of terminology/concepts.
&gt; 
&gt; Where I am coming from: I am trained as a high energy 
&gt; particle physicist and have worked with, but not written, 
&gt; large simulations, e.g., simulations with millions of model 
&gt; elements and simulations with large run times (10's of CPU 
&gt; years 8 years ago.  Since then they have probably racked up a 
&gt; multiple of 1000 CPU years).  I have written simple 
&gt; simulators for particle interactions which I suppose you 
&gt; would call discrete time (but not time on a grid). I have 
&gt; handled random number management over large run-sets and data 
&gt; management. I have worked on application frameworks for this 
&gt; kind of processing, frameworks supporting executables 
&gt; constructed from 100 to 1000 computational modules in a code 
&gt; base of about 4 million lines of C++. In that context, I've 
&gt; worked on release management, parameter management and, in 
&gt; general, pulling out great quantities of hair.  A year ago I 
&gt; started into computational biology at Argonne National Lab 
&gt; where our interests are in whole-cell modeling with an eye 
&gt; towards engineering organisms for hydrogen production and 
&gt; carbon sequestration (greenhouse gasses).

&gt; &gt; Hi Ed,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; In the first place: thank you for initiating the hybrid 
&gt; models working 
&gt; &gt; group, and my apologies for not reacting earlier (I had a to get a 
&gt; &gt; grant proposal out of the way, but that's almost done now).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I think your proposal is very sensible, and I can't tear it 
&gt; apart at 
&gt; &gt; all. You're right in assuming that hybrid modelling has not been 
&gt; &gt; pursued (at least not in detail). What do you mean by "discrete" 
&gt; &gt; simulations, by the way: discrete time (as in cellular automata) or 
&gt; &gt; discrete event (as in stochastic sims), or both?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Come to think about it: it might be useful (well, it would 
&gt; be for me) 
&gt; &gt; to have a list of possible simulation types/modes/frameworks, with 
&gt; &gt; examples. I suspect that this would tie in with the work of the 
&gt; &gt; alternative representations group that Tom has volunteered to start 
&gt; &gt; up.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Getting hold of examples of biological hybrid systems is the most 
&gt; &gt; important thing to do first - and I have a feeling that that is not 
&gt; &gt; going to be as easy as some people think. On the other 
&gt; hand: doesn't 
&gt; &gt; E-Cell support hybrid modelling, Takeshi? In that case you 
&gt; must have 
&gt; &gt; examples. At Poul Nielsen's suggestion, I'll have a look at 
&gt; the CellML 
&gt; &gt; repository - apparently there are several models in there 
&gt; that operate 
&gt; &gt; on very different time scales (which, of course, doesn't 
&gt; necessarily 
&gt; &gt; make them hybrid).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The other thing I would like to know about my fellow group 
&gt; members is 
&gt; &gt; where they are 'coming from' - so that we can make use of the 
&gt; &gt; knowledge that is present. For instance, I am a biochemist (turned 
&gt; &gt; computer scientist in the new millennium) who has measured Kms and 
&gt; &gt; other enzyme-kineticky things. When I was an experimentalist, I've 
&gt; &gt; needed to do continuous (ODE) simulations, and 15 years ago 
&gt; we had a 
&gt; &gt; problem that could only be solved by doing stochastic 
&gt; simulations. The 
&gt; &gt; program that I've been writing over the last 2 years 
&gt; (NetBuilder) is a 
&gt; &gt; discrete time base simulator (but it would like to become 
&gt; hybrid...).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Well, that's quite long enough for now.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Cheers,
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I would be happy to chair this.  With such a small group, I
&gt; &gt; &gt; think that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; just means occasional call-to-arms and some secretarial work.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Charter of the SBML Hybrid Models Working Group
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -----------------------------------------------
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Background
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hybrid Models are those that include phenomena modeled in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fundamentally different ways or which include elements 
&gt; that change 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their mode of operation, or both.  For example, discrete and 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; continuous models are fundamentally different.  A model 
&gt; &gt; &gt; including both
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would be hybrid as would a system including both non-spatial
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; components (represented by ODEs) and spatial components (PDE's, 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reaction-diffusion).
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mission Statement and Scope
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Except for combined continuous/discrete simulation, 
&gt; little hybrid
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; modeling is being pursued in the SBML community [is 
&gt; this correct?]. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus the Hybrid modeling group is at an earlier stage than 
&gt; &gt; &gt; the other
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; groups and the mission statement reflects this.  Our
&gt; &gt; &gt; mission statement
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    1. Enumerate 5 sample problems ("challenges") to be
&gt; &gt; &gt; addressed by hybrid
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;       approaches.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    2. Determine what is needed from SBML to express 
&gt; these models.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    3. Determine what, if any, deliverable there is for 
&gt; the Level 3
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deadline.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Deliverables:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    -  proposal for SBML L3 extensions (this is not 
&gt; expected to be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;       support of hybrid systems, but only support of
&gt; &gt; &gt; limited capabilities
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;       like Events done with an eye toward future, fuller
&gt; &gt; &gt; hybrid systems).
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    -  challenge problems
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    -  SBML requirements for Hybrid systems modeling.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; [This is not meant to be a waterfall process.  I am
&gt; &gt; &gt; actually probing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; here to see if others feel as I do that we are at the very
&gt; &gt; &gt; beginning.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If so, then some time on seeing if we are all talking about
&gt; &gt; &gt; the same
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; things when we say the same words is worthwhile.  The
&gt; &gt; &gt; requirements and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enumeration of challenges is thus more agreement on a
&gt; &gt; &gt; destination than
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a waterfall methodology.]
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Termination criterion:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    -
