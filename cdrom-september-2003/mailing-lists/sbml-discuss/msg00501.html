I wonder if someone from this thread could collect
together and summarize this rather long discussion?
In particular, a summary of the various materials/
papers/etc would be helpful for those of us who
want to sort of follow this work/thread, but not
as deeply as those who are "in the trenches".

&gt; 
&gt; Thanks very much for your explanation, Vijay, Kouichi, 
&gt; Takeshi, Tom, and
&gt; everybody else who has enlightened me (and others, I hope) 
&gt; about hybrid
&gt; simulation/systems.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm now going to read all the material that you've attached over the
&gt; last weeks - particularly the HCC stuff, which sound very promising,
&gt; since it's already a language.

&gt; &gt; &gt;Hi Ed + others,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;I have a book in front of me called "Theory of Modeling and 
&gt; &gt; Simulation" 
&gt; &gt; &gt;2nd ed., by Zeigler, Praehofer &amp; Kim. I remember listening 
&gt; &gt; to a talk on 
&gt; &gt; &gt;E-cell (can't remember whether it was given by Takeshi), in 
&gt; &gt; which this 
&gt; &gt; &gt;book was cited as the 'basis' for E-cell - is that so, Takeshi? It 
&gt; &gt; &gt;seems to me that the theory presented in this book is just 
&gt; &gt; what we need 
&gt; &gt; &gt;for our purposes, but since I'm by no means an expert in 
&gt; this area, 
&gt; &gt; &gt;there may be competing theories. Does Vijay have an 
&gt; opinion on this? 
&gt; &gt; &gt;For the
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have followed the book a little bit. This is certainly in the 
&gt; &gt; framework of "Hybrid Systems" that combine discrete and continuous 
&gt; &gt; system evolution. It should certainly be considered seriously.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I do not have an overall assessment of the work yet; the 
&gt; parts that I 
&gt; &gt; have seen (e.g. the definition of DEVS in Chapter 4) do not 
&gt; seem very 
&gt; &gt; encouraging. I dont think there are structural problems with 
&gt; &gt; their work 
&gt; &gt; -- its just that a lot of obvious material takes up a lot of pages 
&gt; &gt; (thats just a matter of opinion and taste). A number of 
&gt; &gt; critical issues 
&gt; &gt; have been glossed over (at least in Chapter 4) --- e.g. are 
&gt; infinite 
&gt; &gt; sequences of instantaneous transitions allowed? (Ah, I see this is 
&gt; &gt; convered in Chapter 6.2.3, p 141). Why are DEVS not required to be 
&gt; &gt; effectively given ...e.g. the state transition function is 
&gt; &gt; defined over 
&gt; &gt; an uncountable set!?  What happens when an external event 
&gt; &gt; occurs at the 
&gt; &gt; very same time as an internal transition (ah -- I see.. on 
&gt; &gt; page 90 they 
&gt; &gt; introduce a "confluent" transition to handle this problem..this is 
&gt; &gt; messy!!)?  Why does the system output a value only when it 
&gt; &gt; undergoes an 
&gt; &gt; internal transition? Combined with the possibility that there 
&gt; &gt; can be an 
&gt; &gt; infinite sequence of instantaneous transitions, we have the 
&gt; &gt; possibility 
&gt; &gt; of infinite instantaneous output!?! Why are there no continuously 
&gt; &gt; changing state variables -- e.g. as defined by differential 
&gt; &gt; equations?(Ah, looking ahead I see this shows up in Chapter 
&gt;  In fact 
&gt; &gt; this implies that there is no notion of transitions because 
&gt; of state 
&gt; &gt; variables reaching a threshold!  Why does the coupling 
&gt; version (P 86) 
&gt; &gt; not allow feedback loops? The coupled definition is just 
&gt; plain messy 
&gt; &gt; (and also sloppy! Where is X_p defined? is p a port? How is 
&gt; &gt; X_p related 
&gt; &gt; to X_d?) Where is the semantics of the select function defined? The 
&gt; &gt; distinction between the parallel and non-parallel version 
&gt; seems just 
&gt; &gt; plain messy.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; (The book does not appear to have been proof-read well. 
&gt; Chapter 6 is 
&gt; &gt; missing the bibliography ("Sources") even though it has citations. 
&gt; &gt; Another definite drawback of this book is a lack of realistic 
&gt; &gt; examples. 
&gt; &gt; Most examples are quite abstract and mathematical, instead of being 
&gt; &gt; drawn from concrete engineering experience, say, which would also 
&gt; &gt; highlight the connection with real systems analysis and 
&gt; modeling. The 
&gt; &gt; lack of a specific *language* for defining systems is a 
&gt; &gt; definite drawback.)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Now it is quite possibly that some of these limitations are 
&gt; &gt; removed in 
&gt; &gt; subsequent chapters (indeed, skipping ahead, it appears that they 
&gt; &gt; are...). But this points to a problem with the spiral 
&gt; &gt; pedagogical style 
&gt; &gt; of this book (from a researcher's point of view, as opposed to a 
&gt; &gt; student)... one has to go look at the whole book to get an 
&gt; &gt; idea of their 
&gt; &gt; overall system, as opposed to say, a chapter, where the system is 
&gt; &gt; formally defined, its theoretical properties collected etc 
&gt; &gt; etc. Anyway, 
&gt; &gt; that is just to say that for me to understand their 
&gt; &gt; theoretical model is 
&gt; &gt; going to take some time. If anyone else has already worked out the 
&gt; &gt; answers to the questions above, I would be much obliged if they can 
&gt; &gt; enlighten me/us.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; To relate HCC to the terms introduced in this book, HCC is 
&gt; actually a 
&gt; &gt; *language* (built from a very few primitives) that can be used for 
&gt; &gt; modular "multicomponent differential equation systems 
&gt; specifications" 
&gt; &gt; (Chapter 7.6, page 169). However, HCC is built on logic and 
&gt; &gt; constraints, 
&gt; &gt; rather than on "systems theory", so the mappings are not that 
&gt; &gt; clear (at 
&gt; &gt; least at first shot). A lot of the distinctions introduced in 
&gt; &gt; the book 
&gt; &gt; do not seem to be relevant in the case of HCC -- for 
&gt; instance,  input 
&gt; &gt; and output are symmetric in HCC (both correspond to imposition of 
&gt; &gt; constraints); there is no separation between internal and external 
&gt; &gt; transitions. HCC is already closed under parallel composition 
&gt; &gt; (conjunction), so there is no need for a distinction between 
&gt; &gt; "parallel 
&gt; &gt; DEVS" and "classical DEVS".  Systems can be "multicomponent" and 
&gt; &gt; "networked" -- this is just another way of saying that they 
&gt; &gt; are closed 
&gt; &gt; under parallel composition (that is, a parallel composition 
&gt; &gt; of systems 
&gt; &gt; is just another system, hence this operation can be iterated 
&gt; &gt; repeatedly 
&gt; &gt; to obtain a hierarchically defined system).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I would be quite interested in whether the theory of this book can 
&gt; &gt; usefully characterize the other sys biology systems currently 
&gt; &gt; being built.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; For the relevance of hybrid systems to systems biology, I 
&gt; would still 
&gt; &gt; recommend the three papers I cited in an earlier message 
&gt; rather than 
&gt; &gt; this book.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;time being I'll assume that Zeigler et al. have done a good 
&gt; &gt; analysis of 
&gt; &gt; &gt;the process of modelling &amp; simulation, and use what I've 
&gt; &gt; learned from 
&gt; &gt; &gt;the book so far.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;To get back to your email, Ed, Zeigler et al. distinguish 3 types
&gt; &gt; &gt;(formalisms) of dynamic model specification (as opposed to 
&gt; &gt; e.g. object 
&gt; &gt; &gt;modelling, in which there is no concept of time): the Discrete Time
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This is a glaring bunder in the first five pages of this 
&gt; &gt; book, which can 
&gt; &gt; do much harm to readers who may not know better. The whole area of 
&gt; &gt; synchronous programming is about computation with a built-in 
&gt; &gt; notion of 
&gt; &gt; time (discrete and continuous).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;(DTSS), Differential Equation (DESS), and Discrete Event 
&gt; &gt; (DEVS) System 
&gt; &gt; &gt;Specifications. DESS includes ODE and PDE descriptions. DTSS 
&gt; &gt; includes 
&gt; &gt; &gt;things such as cellular automata (which are updated as a 
&gt; whole in a 
&gt; &gt; &gt;unit 'time' step). I think (but I'm not entirely sure) that DEVS 
&gt; &gt; &gt;includes stochastic models (in which possible state 
&gt; transitions have 
&gt; &gt; &gt;certain probabilities), but also threshold models (in 
&gt; which a state 
&gt; &gt; &gt;transition occurs when a certain parameter crosses a given 
&gt; &gt; threshold). 
&gt; &gt; &gt;Have I understood this correctly?
&gt; &gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  DEVS at least as in Chpater 4 do not appear to include stochastic 
&gt; &gt; models or "threshold" models.
