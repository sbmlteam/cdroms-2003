One of the most fundamental issues to decide on with respect to the layout
spec is the unit for the dimensions. I took a look at the postscript ref doc
and found the following sentence:

"The length of a unit along both the x and y axes is 1&amp;#8260;72 inch.
This coordinate system is the default user space." 

The other thing I noticed was:

"A coordinate pair is a pair of real numbers x and y that locate a point
horizontally and vertically within a Cartesian (two-axis) coordinate
system..."

In JDesigner I used the dimension of 1/92 pixels per inch simply because
that's what my screen resolution happen to be at the time. However it's not
difficult to standardize on a default resolution of 1/72 is that's what is
required.

In view of this I would like to put forward the following proposal:

Assume by default that dimensional units are measured in 1/72 of an inch, ie
72dpi.

I don't have any preference on the question of whether to use integers or 
floating point to represent dimensions, I guess floats would be better.

I would suggest an optional resolution in some kind of header (you'll need
some kind of header to store global info, eg background color) so that the
72dpi can be overridden if necessary. eg a diagram might have been drawn at
300dpi (ready for printing perhaps), thus the SBML file should have this
info for other apps that read the file. An example of this would be an
application than translates the SBML layout into raw SVG or some other
vector format (There doesn't seem to be a great advantage in using SVG per
se since applications can easily translate the SBML to other formats, eg
SVG, PS, or even bitmap formats).

Note that we need some form of unit system because our fonts are specified
in terms of 1/72 units (hence 1/72 is a convenient size to settle on). I
don't think our unit system can be dimensionless.

Units are probably the first thing we must settle on so what are people's
comments in this?

I think we should try and avoid allowing other units to be employed directly
in the SBML file, eg inchs, cm etc because it would such a pain to deal with
at the programmatic level. The dimensions can in any case be set by the
resolution specifier in the header so it wouldn't be difficult to translate
the coords to other units *in* the application. It would make life a lot
easier if we just used one unit type in the SBML file. I don't think we
loose nothing in the process as far as I can see. Comments?
