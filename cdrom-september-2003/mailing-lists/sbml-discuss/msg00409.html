&gt; I understand the example above, I think it makes sense and our
&gt; proposal would certainly look similar if we put the layout separate
&gt; from the model. What I donÂ´t understand is how this solves Ralphs
&gt; problem. SBML allows several identical species references in a
&gt; reaction. I think every species reference in the model should (at
&gt; least potentially) be related to an arc (or arrow or however you
&gt; like to name it) in the layout. So if the layout is put separate from
&gt; the model there needs to be a way to unambiguously refer to a
&gt; species reference.
 
First of all, if we need a way to reference speciesReferences,
then we add whatever we need to speciesReference. It's that
simple.
 
I propose to add SID to speciesReference. In fact, I propose
to add it to Level 2, and not even wait for Level 3. In the
language of databases, SID is the primary key, and in my
view, everything should have a primary key, EVEN IF YOU
CAN'T SEE AN IMMEDIATE USE FOR IT. The alternative
argument is, we have now identified an immediate use for
SID in speciesReference, so let's put it in there.
 
And, the sooner the better. Let's put it into Level 2.
 
I don't see why SID isn't put into SBase (the primary key
argument would imply it belongs here). I say let's put it
into SBase in Level 2.
 
And *THAT* takes care of the referencing problem.

&gt; I think you completely lost me there.
&gt; Could you please try to explain this in more detail?
&gt; I think putting the layout with the elements they belong to would rid 
&gt; us of the referencing problem without any real disadvantages.

As for keeping the view separate from the model, there
is a long history of this as a general design principle, and
one of the reasons for doing so is that it accomodates
"multiple views" in a seamless and simple manner, as
is the case here. Moreover, there is the argument that
what something is and how something looks on-screen
are two completely separate and different things, and
thus do not conceptually belong together. Third is, it's
much easier to specify the view if it is not constrained
by the constraints associated with the model definition.
 
For an example, if a reaction has the constraint that a
species can only appear once in a reaction (as a reactant,
modifier or product), then putting the view definition(s) into
the reaction definition means that the view ALSO must have
the constraint that species can appear only once in a reaction
in the visual layout of that reaction. Now, this may or may
not be how you want to constrain the layout of the reaction,
but the point is, by putting the layout into the model you no
longer have the choice of constraining the layout differently.
For example, some of us may want to allow a species to
visually appear on both the left and the right of a reaction.
 
The OBVIOUS example is a catalyst, which some of us may
want to visually lay out as E + S --&gt; E + P (where E appears
as a reactant and a product visually, but when we write out
the reaction definition, E would not appear as either, it would
appear as a modifier). This would not be possible if the
layout definition were stuck into the reaction definition.
 
But again, this is just a generally accepted design principle
that has been around for a very long time for very good reason,
and it's so ubiquitous that it has a name (Model-View-Controller)
and is almost always referred to as MVC. We tend to live by
this rule (because we're tired of dying by ignoring it).

&gt; This is what I wanted to say. Basically that a reaction has a graphical
&gt; representation and that the minimum set of information that needs to be
&gt; defined is the place where the arcs meet.
 
and

&gt; The speciesreference is the object in the reaction that says which
&gt; species take part in the reaction. The arrows in the diagram are the
&gt; objects that connect a reaction center to a graphical representaiton
&gt; of a species. In the same way as the graphical representation of a
&gt; reaction is the sum of the center and the arrows, the reaction itself
&gt; is the sum of the name, kinetic function and all the speciesreferences.
&gt; That makes it natural to map the arrows (or arcs) to the species
&gt; references. I do not see how an arrow would make sense that could
&gt; not be attributed to exactly one speciesreference. And a species
&gt; reference has a direction since it is in the list of reactants or in the
&gt; list of products.
 
We (The Virtual Cell group) couldn't agree more, because we happen
to be one of those groups that uses a visual object to represent reactions
(for hooking reactants, modifiers and products to). But, I hesitate to
specify what the reaction piece looks like, because for many groups, it
is not really a visually represented object. But as always, I'm perfectly
happy allowing tools to specify what it looks like, then letting other
tools ignore it (if, for example, they don't visually display such things).
 
I don't want to get tied down to one group's particular representation,
though, so it's important to do this part of it in such a way that it works
for all and such that it can be converted (after reading the XML file)
into whatever particular framework the importing tool contains.
 
I think it's important to focus on the content--that is, what do we
(ie. the tools) absolutely NEED in order to specify it.
