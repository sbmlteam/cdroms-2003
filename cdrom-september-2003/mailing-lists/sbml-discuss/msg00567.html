&gt; We actually have three connection points, with
&gt; the third being where the catalysts/modifiers
&gt; hook in. Of course, for us, it's no problem to
&gt; compute where that is: it's midway between the
&gt; reactants and products points.

That´s what we also had in mind for the modifiers. 

&gt;
&gt; But, I wonder if we're overthinking this a bit,
&gt; and think it's worth confirming what it is we
&gt; are after. You see, no matter what representation(s)
&gt; we come up with in the SBML, after we read the
&gt; model into the Virtual Cell, we are going to ONLY
&gt; be able to render it in our renderer, so there will
&gt; obviously be *some* conversion. Now, those of you
&gt; who have seen the Virtual Cell may remember that we
&gt; represent reactions as a "barbell" shaped glyph
&gt; (which Jim has since modified a bit). Thus, while
&gt; the EML group is thinking of a reaction glyph being
&gt; a short line segment between two points, after
&gt; reading their models into the Virtual Cell, their
&gt; reactions will look like a "barbell" NO MATTER WHAT.
&gt;
&gt; And that was a best-case scenario, since EML's rep
&gt; and the Virtual Cell's rep are almost identical.
&gt; Now, consider the case where Herbert imports one
&gt; of their models, with his rep being quite distinct.
&gt;
&gt; And this leads me to my point: are we trying to
&gt; specify *EXACTLY* what a reaction should look like,
&gt; and then expecting that EXACT look to be reproduced?
&gt;
&gt; The answer is obviously NO.

This is why we chose to differentiate between layout information and render 
information in our proposal (by just ignoring the render part so far). 
For species it is easy. The layout information is the position of the glyph 
(we also added the size). We do not say whether it is a circle or a square, 
which color, ...
For the reactions it is not so easy. We compromised on what we think is a 
quite abstract representation of a reaction glyph: The points where the 
substrate arcs meet and the point where the product arcs meet. Alternatively 
you can read this as one point where all the arcs meet and the tangent 
direction. 
When we first wrote our proposal we were not shure if additional information 
about the curves really belongs to the layout information, so this 
information is not yet in there (I now believe it should be in).  

This is also why we think a species reference glyph should have a role 
attribute. A renderer that decides not to bother reading detailed curve 
information from the file should have some clue how to render. And since 
glyphs that don´t refer to a specific model object are allowed (at least in 
our proposal) the information can not be retrieved from the model.

&gt;
&gt; And this leads me to the next question, which was
&gt; brought up before but was not answered to my satisfaction
&gt; (which was OK, I thought it might be good to make some
&gt; progress before revisiting it): just how far do we
&gt; want to go in specifying the EXACT DETAILS of what
&gt; the layout looked like in each particular tool?
&gt;
&gt; Perhaps this would be a good time to think about
&gt; this question again, before we embark on trying
&gt; to spec out two different approaches to reactions,
&gt; or generalizing them into one that works both ways.
&gt;

&gt;
&gt; &gt; From: Sven Sahle [<A  HREF="mailto:sven.sahle@eml.villa-bosch.de">mailto:sven.sahle@eml.villa-bosch.de</A>]
&gt; &gt; it seems that, again, we will have to make some general decision:
&gt; &gt; Do we want to have several ways to represent reactions in our
&gt; &gt; layout (to
&gt; &gt; reflect the different way existing programs deal with
&gt; &gt; reactions) or do we
&gt; &gt; want to find one way to represent reactions.
&gt; &gt; The one way would need to be fairly general to allow most
&gt; &gt; other cases to be
&gt; &gt; translated. It would therefore be unnecessarily complex for
&gt; &gt; some simple
&gt; &gt; cases.
