Didn't quite understand your reply.

&gt;the rates of change of amount are 

&gt;A' = -k[A]
&gt;B' = k[A]
&gt;C' = k[A]

i.e brackets are used here to indicate amount, but the agreed notation is
to use brackets when referring to concentration.

Herbert

I was using square brackets 
explicitly make the distinction.

&gt; I quick notation correction, square brackets are used to 
&gt; denote concentration, thus it is not wise to them in the
&gt; context of amount, otherwise people will think you mean concentration.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Folks
&gt; 
&gt; The following is a draft message for
&gt; sbml-discuss to justify our definition
&gt; of rate laws of reactions to be in terms
&gt; rate of change of amount as opposed
&gt; to rate of change of concentration.
&gt; 
&gt; I need a sanity check on this before
&gt; I post this to sbml-discuss.
&gt; 
&gt; [perhaps this justification could be
&gt; inserted as an appendix to the L2 proposal
&gt; document in a better form].
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Folks
&gt; 
&gt; Nicolas Le Novere raised the issue of the
&gt; units of kinetic laws in SBML.
&gt; 
&gt; In both L1 and L2 the formula used to
&gt; define the rate of a given reaction is defined
&gt; to be amount/time (moles/second by default).
&gt; This is reasonable since reactions change
&gt; species amount directly and only species
&gt; concentration indirectly.
&gt; 
&gt; We are aware that many modelers use
&gt; concentration/time or amount/volume/time
&gt; (moles/liter/second by default) when
&gt; defining rate of change formulae
&gt; for species.  Thus we defined
&gt; speciesConcentration rules that have these
&gt; units.
&gt; 
&gt; So at first this may seem to be inconsistent both
&gt; within SBML and perhaps with the approach of the
&gt; modeling community.
&gt; 
&gt; However there is a reason for this:
&gt; 
&gt; a) Kinetic laws on reactions don't define the
&gt; rate of change of a single species. In fact
&gt; the rate of change of species is composed
&gt; from the rate laws of all reactions in which
&gt; the species is either a reactant or product.
&gt; The result is a formula that defines a rate of
&gt; change of amount for the species.
&gt; 
&gt; b) A reaction can have a transport component
&gt; i.e. move species from one compartment to another
&gt; where each compartment can have a different volume.
&gt; 
&gt; Consider the situation where there are 3 species A, B and
&gt; C all in separate compartments with volumes Va, Vb, and Vc
&gt; respectively.  We define a transporting reaction A -&gt; B + C
&gt; with a rate law k[A]
&gt; 
&gt; the rates of change of amount are
&gt; 
&gt; A' = -k[A]
&gt; B' = k[A]
&gt; C' = k[A]
&gt; 
&gt; and thus the rates of change of concentration are:
&gt; 
&gt; [A]' = -k[A]/Va
&gt; [B]' = k[A]/Vb
&gt; [C]' = k[A]/Vc
&gt; 
&gt; One immediate observation of this is if you
&gt; don't care about volume and compartments:
&gt; you just locate everything inside a single unit
&gt; compartment and then [A] = A thus returning the
&gt; math to the conventional representation.
&gt; In fact one of the options for SBML L2
&gt; is to have 'default' unit volume compartment
&gt; i.e. if you don't supply a compartment the distinction
&gt; between amount and concentration effectively disappears.
&gt; 
&gt; Lets consider a definition of rate laws that
&gt; might seem rational: the rate law defines the rate of
&gt; change of concentration of the species in the reaction.
&gt; Thus we have
&gt; 
&gt; [A]' = -k[A]
&gt; [B]' = k[A]
&gt; [C]' = k[A]
&gt; 
&gt; therefore the rates of change of amount are
&gt; 
&gt; A' = -k[A]Va
&gt; B' = k[A]Vb
&gt; C' = k[A]Vc
&gt; 
&gt; Hopefully you'd agree that this is incorrect:
&gt; this suggests that you can increase the rate of increate of
&gt; amount of C simply by increasing the volume of C's compartment.
&gt; 
&gt; Can I rest my case?
