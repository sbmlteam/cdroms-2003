  <pre wrap="">Hi Vijay,


Thank you for the response.  This discussion is really a fun for me.


Well, the source of the fundamental difference between our ways of thinking is that
you are working on formal languages, while I am a numeric simulator writer.
Sometimes I find myself counting the number of possible assembler instructions and
pointer dereferences when I think about a new algorithm.   I don't think you 
think like this; you'd be rather thinking about formal consistency and the semantics
of possible language representations when you hit on the new algorithm :)

I wish life were so simple :-)! I have been the architect, main designer
and implementer of AT&amp;T's Instant Messaging system (several hundred thousand
users), and led engineering teams that have taken two products to market
in the Internet/wireless server space i the last three years. &nbsp;And nearly
fifteen years ago I implemented another commercial product, Carnegie Group's
Prolog engine in Lisp integrated with Mark Fox's Schema Representation Language...
so I have been around the block a few times :-)<br>
<br>
So lets put the credentials aside. Obviously, its really important to work
through the bits and tweak your system's performance. Its equally important
to make sure that the validity of your user's modeling efforts dont depend
on it! <br>

      <pre wrap="">Another possible view, however, is to see simulation algorithms as indivisible
parts of the models.    Every simulation model reflects its modeler's understanding
of certain real phenomenon, and it can be thought that some part of the 'understanding'
is implicitly coded in the computational procedure, or the simulation algorithm.
The same model can produce completely different results when driven by different
algorithms, and as we better understand the nature of the phenomenon, we becomes
to be able to create more suitable algorithms, or just to choose more appropriate algorithms
correctly.

I don't think these two views conflict.   These are just parallel understanding of the
same thing.

      </pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre wrap="">I think they really conflict around inter-operability. 
    </pre>
  </blockquote>
  <pre wrap="">
AND I still think these don't conflict.
But wait, I admit I needed to clarify more about the difference between
these two viewpoints.

I was not talking about the syntax/semantics separation when I said algorithms
are parts of models, though I was when I said we must distinguish models
from implementations.   And I was not talking about languages.
When talking about formal languages and induction engines
it is the core concept, but in numerical simulators it is not always true.
You may agree that if we need to assure the interoperability, it should be 
done in the level of the higher level languages, not in data structures of
implementations.

I meant that when we choose to use differential equations it implicitly but definitely
indicate we understand, or at least we are trying to understand the dynamics of 
the model in terms of, continuous and deterministic computation (I meant this
by 'algorithm').   
  </pre>
</blockquote>
Two points.<br>
<br>
(1) Hmm. Of course differential equations have dynamic content, just as procedures
and higher-order functions do (albeit for different notions of "time"). &nbsp;But
this doesnt mean that they have to be understood only through their "execution".
In all these cases there are also abtract mathematical ways of understanding
them.<br>
<br>
(2) I dont believe that there is anything fundamentally different about "numerical
simulators" vs "formal languages and induction engines". (I dont actually
know what induction engines you are talking about; I assume you mean reasoning
engines). The only distinction I see is that one deals with the continuous
domain --- and of course that has a lot of interesting and challenging structure
in its own right -- and the other has traditionally dealt with discrete phenomena.<br>
<br>
(3) There may be another thing going on here. There is of course a lot of
really good work to be done around meta-architectures for modeling and reasoning:
systems intended to be extensible by end-users, each extension to be thought
of as yielding an architecture for reasoning. The possibility of such meta-architectures
has really been facilitated over the last 20 years by the emergence of OO
languages, and reflection/introspection techniques. Indeed a well-designed
API can allow the same user to write a program which both (a) specializes
the reasoning engine (b) provides input (models) to the reasoning engine.
This may be accomplished merely by subclassing a few well-chosen classses,
for instance. <br>
<br>
But lets bring the discussion back to SBML. At least my sense from participating
in the last meeting is that SBML is not about trying to formalize such an
API for different reasoners in the systems biology domain (though that can
be a very interesting task!). Instead there is already a commitment to using
an XML-based language, essentially as a declarative representation for a
notation intended primarily to describe "subject domain" phenomena, i.e.
pathways of interaction, kinetics etc etc.<br>
<br>
Again, please correct me if I am wrong -- I am new to SBML.<br>

    <pre wrap="">So I would strongly encourage you to think hard about the semantics of 
your language. 
The fundamental question to ask is:  Can a user of your 
notation understand whether  the particular program s/he is writing (in 
your notation) is "correct" for the situation at hand, independent of 
his/her knowledge of the details of your execution engine ("operational 
semantics")?
    </pre>
  </blockquote>
  <pre wrap="">
Of course this is a very important point.   
Design of my software is layered; its language (EML) is basically just
persistence of its simulator object model,
and on top of that another higher level of semantic representation will be built (or just
use SBML when it is ready to cover all the functionalities of the
software).


  </pre>
  <blockquote type="cite">
    <pre wrap="">Though perhaps a point of agreement is that annotations to models may 
certainly include references to preferred or known execution engines 
that can be used with them. i.e. notes on the usage of the model. This 
"pragmatic" view is perhaps a way to bridge the "conceptual" gap.
    </pre>
  </blockquote>
  <pre wrap="">
Yes, this is what I was going to propose.   
And I think there are some levels:   the model just 'can' be run with that
algorithm, or the algorithm 'must' be used for it to guarantee validity
of the model.   Or there can also be a 'should' level.   
Another a bit more sophisticated, but slightly smells like the 'design by committee'
antipattern, is to force all simulation engines to declare their capabilities in detail, 
and let the model to indicate what is the requirement to run it correctly.</pre>
</blockquote>
This idea comes up all the time, e.g. in the case of describing capabilities
of document rendering devices (W3C Composite Capability/Preference Profile
see e.g. <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CCPP-struct-vocab/">http://www.w3.org/TR/CCPP-struct-vocab/</a>). &nbsp;To do this for modeling
and simulation engines is yet another very interesting research challenge!
<br>
<br>
But I dont think this is within the scope of SBML discussions. Folks should
feel free to correct me if I am wrong.<br>

      <pre wrap="">mportance of the 'continuous/discrete hybrid' of course does not decreases
here.  Rather the multi-algorithm framework is-a hybrid (I mean it is a subclass),
and it is indispensable to elegantly design and implement it.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre wrap="">Certainly the choice of the phrase "Hybrid Systems" to name the sub-area 
we are talking about is highly unfortunate: each of the words is widely 
applicable, as well as the combination. But given that this choice is 
made, I would recommend not fighting it, but looking for other technical 
names to name different concepts.

  </blockquote>
  <pre wrap="">
In device simulation, such as SPICE, a hybrid electronic/electric
digital/analog simulator, they call it mixed-mode.     
(I used to call multi-algorithm mixed-mode, but I quited using this
 term  for E-Cell when I knew they use it to mean this.)

I think this is a fairly common term in that community.   I'm not sure this is
the best name for us, though.
  </pre>

Mixed-mode seems reasonable, unless you or anyone else has a better suggestion...<br>
