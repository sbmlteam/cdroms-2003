John, Herbert, Ralph et al.--

I brought up the logical/physical distinction to try summarizing points that 
Andrew F and Sven S had made. Sven had talked about separating levels (model, 
layout, render), and Andrew about very similar ideas (encoding graph 
information, and minimal rendering information, augmenting these with a 
stylesheet for detailed rendering).

What this reminded me of is the way e.g. different browsers can render the same 
HTML logical tags in different ways. Because SBML is an XML language it lets us 
specify the structure of the model very nicely, but different 
modeling/simulation packages will have varying preferences in how to present 
this model. Thus Andrew's suggestion to use stylesheets for detailed rendering, 
as I interpreted it, referred to one possible method on the *package* side and 
not to a requirement for the SBML specification of the model. As Andrew and Hugh 
S point out, this means having a controlled vocabulary for the types of objects, 
whose appearance is then determined by the package.

Andrew's neat idea that models could define their own CVs seems long-term 
feasible and powerful, but under time pressure might best be deferred. But the 
various types rendered by existing packages aren't nearly as rich as some of the 
CVs and ontologies out there, so as Mike H suggested, an inventory of their 
"common themes" isn't too onerous. For example, in pathSCOUT and its current 
descendant, we distinguish several types of molecules (or other actors), and 
types of interactions (or other actions), each of which has its own appearance 
(listed below). The actors and actions correspond to the CV, and the appearance 
correspond to the stylesheet information (though in pS this is actually hard 
coded in constants in the code).

I wouldn't claim the CV below is complete or ideal (quite the contrary); it's 
just one candidate to contribute to the inventory, and it's rich enough for many 
purposes.

Bottom line: I go along with Ralph G's suggestion to try getting out a level A 
proposal over the summer, but disagree with Ralph &amp; Herbert that inventorying 
the CV is too much. Whether the inventory is done by the DWG or the CV-WG (or 
both), enumerating the logical themes and agreeing on a minimal set is eminently 
do-able in the short term.

...At least from what I've seen of this group, in comparison with 
standardization efforts in general....;)

"actors"
--------
compound: ellipse
protein: rectangle
enzyme: rectangle with dotted border
complex: two ellipses orthogonally superimposed
polymer: three ellipses joined along minor axis (like part of a bead necklace)
gene: elongated hexagon
RNA: pentagon
pathway: tiny graph with three nodes &amp; two edges
compartment: rounded rectangular border containing actors &amp; actions

"actions"
---------
interaction: solid line
binding: dashed line
reaction (mass transfer): solid line with single solid arrow
reversible reaction:
activation: solid line with open arrow
inhibition: solid line with short line abutting orthogonally
transcription: dotted line with single barbed arrow
translation: dotted line with two barbed arrows at terminus
transport: dotted line with three barbed arrows at terminus
conformation change: dotted line with two barbed arrows, one at each end

P.S. Describing these is easier with an image but that would probably violate 
some policy or another.
