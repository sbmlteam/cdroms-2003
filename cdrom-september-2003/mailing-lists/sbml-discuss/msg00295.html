&gt; &gt; First, we HAVE TO HAVE membranes. 
&gt; &gt; What we really want is a completely separate
&gt; &gt; element, called membrane; this element will
&gt; &gt; then serve as a container for all of the
&gt; &gt; *other* membrane pieces we want/need
&gt; I strongly disagree with that statement. We HAVE
&gt; TO HAVE compartments of various dimensionality.
Yes, I was not precise. We (and by we, I mean, the
Virtual Cell group) have to have some way of
representing those things that separate compartments.

&gt; The example you give just require a 2-D compartment,
&gt; sandwiched between 3D-compartments. If we begin to
&gt; create SBML elements representing biological components,
&gt; we'll end up having a mapping between SBML and the
&gt; component vocabulary of Gene Ontology.
&gt; In the 1D, you'll have &lt;microfilament&gt;, &lt;microtubule&gt;,
&gt; then in addition to the &lt;membrane&gt;, you'll need things
&gt; like &lt;lipid_rafts&gt; etc.
Thanks for bringing these up. We need those things too.

&gt; [...] Why not really expand the compartment element to
&gt; describe it?
This is basically what I described as the first option,
and we're perfectly happy with this option--provided it
is done well enough that it can (now or later) elegantly
include other things we need, like membrane potential.

One of the reasons I like that approach is that it *does*
allow specification of microfilaments, etc...that is,
compartments of all dimensions.

However, we were, at the time, unable to come up with
a generalization of the word "volume" that would make
sense regardless of the dimension of the compartment;
one suggestion was "size", but if everyone else can
live with "volume" we can as well (keeping in mind
that the highest-level compartment's dimension may
not be 3).

&gt; And we're just talking about the cell. But Systems
&gt; Biology is about global study of biological systems,
&gt; whatever the organizational level. Let's think to
&gt; the Noble/Hunter simulations of whole organs and
&gt; individuals ... 
Agreed. But the SBML already makes the assumption that
one has compartments, which may or may not make sense
for all Systems Biology models. (Cliff is starting to
bring me over to his Dark Side... :)
