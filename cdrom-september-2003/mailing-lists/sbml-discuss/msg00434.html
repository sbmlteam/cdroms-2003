Folks

IMHO I think we interpreted the intention of the community
correctly.  L1 and all the L2 drafts have used concentration
as the units for species in expressions.  I don't recall
any mention of any concensus for change to this either on
sbml-discuss or at the meeting at Florida.

This seems reasonable as must rate lwas are specified in 
terms of concentration variables.

Further clarification:

The way the specification is written at the moment is
as Mike has written.  Please don't try to interpret
this until you have read and commented on Mike's email first.

The following are additional details:

- species initial value can be specified
	as substance or concentration (by using the initialAmont
	or initialConcentration attributes respectively)

	However species symbols in forumlae ALWAYS
	have concentration units unless the spatial
	dimensions of the containing compartment
	is 0 in which case the species symbol
	has substance units.

	The initialConcentration attribute can't be used
	if the spatial dimensions of the species' compartment is 0.

- the specific units of species symbols in formulae depend on
	the units specified on the species structure,
	the spatial dimensions of the compartment and
	the units of the compartment.

	The units specified for a species symbol are those
	specified on the species structure if the initial
	value was specified using initialConcentration (or if
	the spatial dimensions of the compartment is 0)

	The units specified for a species symbol are those
	specified on the species structure combined with those
	specified on the compartment structure if the inital value
	was specified using initialAmount and the spatial dimensions
	of the compartment is not 0.

	The units used on species must be appropriate to the
	to initial value attribute used and to the spatial dimensions
	of the compartment.

Please comment on the above.

Specifically do you think having spatial dimensions of 0 is
appropriate/useful?

yours

&gt; Subject: [sbml-discuss] Someone please set me straight on this
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; People,
&gt; 
&gt; I confess I've become confused over what people want to see
&gt; as far as species units.  After rereading the many messages 
&gt; about this on sbml-discuss, and comparing this to what we 
&gt; just wrote in the L2 final draft spec, it's no longer clear 
&gt; to me how people want to interpret the appearance of a 
&gt; species symbol in a math expression.  Should it be a number 
&gt; in units of substance, or in units of concentration?
&gt; 
&gt; Note that this is separate from the question of what the 
&gt; initial value for a species should be (people want the option 
&gt; of using either concentration or substance) and also the 
&gt; question of what the reaction rate expression should be 
&gt; (people want substance/time, not concentration/time).  I 
&gt; think those questions are settled at this point.
&gt; 
&gt; In the spec as written, we wrote that species identifiers in 
&gt; math expressions stand for the quantity of that species in 
&gt; terms of CONCENTRATION units.  However, Joerg Weimar's recent 
&gt; feedback, and a number of past messages on sbml-discuss, make 
&gt; it seem that perhaps it should be in SUBSTANCE units.
&gt; 
&gt; Using substance units would appear to be more consistent
&gt; with having reaction rates be in terms of substance/time.
&gt; One could generate concentrations by dividing species by the 
&gt; compartments in which they're located.  So if one has two 
&gt; reactions, A -&gt; B + C and B -&gt; D, with the former having a 
&gt; rate of "k1*A" and the latter "k2*B" (where "A" and "B" 
&gt; represent substance amounts), and each species is located in 
&gt; separate compartments with volumes Va, Vb, Vc, and Vd, then 
&gt; the rate of change in amount of B would be
&gt; 
&gt;    dB/dt = k1*A - k2*B
&gt; 
&gt; and the rate of change of concentration in B would be
&gt; 
&gt;    d[B]/dt = k1*A/Va - k2*B/Vb
&gt; 
&gt; Is that right?  Does that work for more complicated cases?
&gt; 
&gt; I'm sorry to bring this up.  I hope this is a simple
&gt; question and people can just tell me it's obvious that we're 
&gt; going one way or the other.
&gt; 
&gt; MH
