Hi John,

A bit late, but here's my interpretation of the hybrid models discussion
so far (fortunately not a lot has been added to the discussion since
your email, which makes it a bit simpler).

Before the 'official' discussion started, Ed and Vijay agreed that the
Level 2 'hybrid stuff' (events and delays) "simply in isolation from the
full hybrid problem" and "likely to be incompatible with or not
extensible to a full hybrid system".

Ed then listed the things that need to be done, and after some
discussion we settled (well, I *think* it's settled) on the following
tasks and deliverables for the Hybrid Models Working Group:

1. List modelling formalisms.
2. Enumerate 5 sample problems ("challenges") to be addressed by hybrid
approaches.
3. Determine what is needed from SBML to express these models.
4. Determine what, if any, deliverable there is for the Level 3
deadline.

Deliverables:
-  Refinement of terminology and concepts.
-  proposal for SBML L3 extensions (this is not expected to be support
of hybrid systems, but only support of limited capabilities like Events
done with an eye toward future, fuller hybrid systems).
-  challenge problems
-  SBML requirements for Hybrid systems modeling.

The main topic of discussion so far has been what we mean when we say
"hybrid systems" or "hybrid models". Vijay gave a very clear summary of
his view (in
<A  HREF="http://www.sbw-sbml.org/sbml-discuss/archive/msg00464.html">http://www.sbw-sbml.org/sbml-discuss/archive/msg00464.html</A>), with
several refs:

H Matsuno, A Doi, M Nagasaki and S Miyano "Hybrid petri net 
representations of gene regulatory networks", Pacfiic Symposium on 
Biocomputing, 5:333-349, 2000.

R Alur, C Belta, F Ivancic, V Kumar, M Mintz, G J Pappas, H Rubin and J 
Schung "Hybrid modeling and simulation of biomolecual networks" In 
Hyurid Systmes: Computation and Control, HSCC 2001, Rome Italy, pages 
19-32, Springer Verlag LNCS 2034, 2001.

A Bockmayr and A Courtois "Using hybrid concurrent constraint 
programming to model dynamic biological systems", ICLP 2002. (attached:
BockmayrCourtois.ps)

and added in a later email: D Eveillard, D Ropers, H de Jong, C
Branlant, A Bockmayr "A Multi-site constraint programming model of
alternative splicing regulation", submitted for publication (attached:
RappINRIA.ps).

Vijay et al have formalized description of hybrid systems in a language
called Hybrid Concurrent Constraints (HCC), which has been applied to
several biological problems (e.g. by Alexander Bockmayr and coworkers).

Several HMWG members are developing simulators that use continuous
(various ODE) and discrete event (Gillespie/Gibson) algorithms. Kouichi
&amp; Takeshi contributed takahashi03-1.pdf (attached), and Tom sent
Hybrid.pdf (both attached).

Koichi gave his view in
<A  HREF="http://www.sbw-sbml.org/sbml-discuss/archive/msg00465.html">http://www.sbw-sbml.org/sbml-discuss/archive/msg00465.html</A> and he and
Vijay discussed model-simulator dependency (does the simulator determine
the model or should it be the other way round? Vijay says model -&gt;
simulator, Kouichi argues for the opposite, if I have understood it
correctly - it's clearly not trivial. This is an important discussion,
because the shape of SBML Level X will depend on its outcome). See the
rest of that thread for the actual discussion.

In one of my emails
(<A  HREF="http://www.sbw-sbml.org/sbml-discuss/archive/msg00477.html">http://www.sbw-sbml.org/sbml-discuss/archive/msg00477.html</A>), I
mentioned the book "Theory of Modeling and Simulation" 2nd ed., by
Zeigler, Praehofer &amp; Kim. Some, but not all, of the theory in this book
(Discrete Event and Differential Equation System Specification,
DEVS&amp;DESS) has been used for E-Cell by Kouichi (how he used it is in
<A  HREF="http://www.sbw-sbml.org/sbml-discuss/archive/msg00485.html">http://www.sbw-sbml.org/sbml-discuss/archive/msg00485.html</A>). Vijay -
from a 'rivaling' point of view, if I may express it like that - has
commented on the book in
<A  HREF="http://www.sbw-sbml.org/sbml-discuss/archive/msg00491.html">http://www.sbw-sbml.org/sbml-discuss/archive/msg00491.html</A>.

That was it, I believe. Hope it helps.

Cheers,

Maria (now working through the above papers)

&gt; I wonder if someone from this thread could collect
&gt; together and summarize this rather long discussion?
&gt; In particular, a summary of the various materials/
&gt; papers/etc would be helpful for those of us who
&gt; want to sort of follow this work/thread, but not
&gt; as deeply as those who are "in the trenches".

&gt; &gt; Thanks very much for your explanation, Vijay, Kouichi,
&gt; &gt; Takeshi, Tom, and
&gt; &gt; everybody else who has enlightened me (and others, I hope) 
&gt; &gt; about hybrid
&gt; &gt; simulation/systems.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I'm now going to read all the material that you've attached 
&gt; over the 
&gt; &gt; last weeks - particularly the HCC stuff, which sound very 
&gt; promising, 
&gt; &gt; since it's already a language.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Hi Ed + others,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I have a book in front of me called "Theory of Modeling and
&gt; &gt; &gt; Simulation"
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;2nd ed., by Zeigler, Praehofer &amp; Kim. I remember listening
&gt; &gt; &gt; to a talk on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;E-cell (can't remember whether it was given by Takeshi), in
&gt; &gt; &gt; which this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;book was cited as the 'basis' for E-cell - is that so, 
&gt; Takeshi? It
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;seems to me that the theory presented in this book is just 
&gt; &gt; &gt; what we need
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;for our purposes, but since I'm by no means an expert in
&gt; &gt; this area,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;there may be competing theories. Does Vijay have an
&gt; &gt; opinion on this?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;For the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have followed the book a little bit. This is certainly in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; framework of "Hybrid Systems" that combine discrete and 
&gt; continuous 
&gt; &gt; &gt; system evolution. It should certainly be considered seriously.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I do not have an overall assessment of the work yet; the
&gt; &gt; parts that I
&gt; &gt; &gt; have seen (e.g. the definition of DEVS in Chapter 4) do not
&gt; &gt; seem very
&gt; &gt; &gt; encouraging. I dont think there are structural problems with
&gt; &gt; &gt; their work 
&gt; &gt; &gt; -- its just that a lot of obvious material takes up a lot 
&gt; of pages 
&gt; &gt; &gt; (thats just a matter of opinion and taste). A number of 
&gt; &gt; &gt; critical issues 
&gt; &gt; &gt; have been glossed over (at least in Chapter 4) --- e.g. are 
&gt; &gt; infinite
&gt; &gt; &gt; sequences of instantaneous transitions allowed? (Ah, I see this is
&gt; &gt; &gt; convered in Chapter 6.2.3, p 141). Why are DEVS not 
&gt; required to be 
&gt; &gt; &gt; effectively given ...e.g. the state transition function is 
&gt; &gt; &gt; defined over 
&gt; &gt; &gt; an uncountable set!?  What happens when an external event 
&gt; &gt; &gt; occurs at the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; very same time as an internal transition (ah -- I see.. on 
&gt; &gt; &gt; page 90 they 
&gt; &gt; &gt; introduce a "confluent" transition to handle this 
&gt; problem..this is 
&gt; &gt; &gt; messy!!)?  Why does the system output a value only when it 
&gt; &gt; &gt; undergoes an 
&gt; &gt; &gt; internal transition? Combined with the possibility that there 
&gt; &gt; &gt; can be an 
&gt; &gt; &gt; infinite sequence of instantaneous transitions, we have the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; possibility 
&gt; &gt; &gt; of infinite instantaneous output!?! Why are there no continuously 
&gt; &gt; &gt; changing state variables -- e.g. as defined by differential 
&gt; &gt; &gt; equations?(Ah, looking ahead I see this shows up in Chapter 
&gt; &gt;  In fact
&gt; &gt; &gt; this implies that there is no notion of transitions because
&gt; &gt; of state
&gt; &gt; &gt; variables reaching a threshold!  Why does the coupling
&gt; &gt; version (P 86)
&gt; &gt; &gt; not allow feedback loops? The coupled definition is just
&gt; &gt; plain messy
&gt; &gt; &gt; (and also sloppy! Where is X_p defined? is p a port? How is
&gt; &gt; &gt; X_p related 
&gt; &gt; &gt; to X_d?) Where is the semantics of the select function 
&gt; defined? The 
&gt; &gt; &gt; distinction between the parallel and non-parallel version 
&gt; &gt; seems just
&gt; &gt; &gt; plain messy.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; (The book does not appear to have been proof-read well.
&gt; &gt; Chapter 6 is
&gt; &gt; &gt; missing the bibliography ("Sources") even though it has citations.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Another definite drawback of this book is a lack of realistic 
&gt; &gt; &gt; examples. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Most examples are quite abstract and mathematical, 
&gt; instead of being 
&gt; &gt; &gt; drawn from concrete engineering experience, say, which would also 
&gt; &gt; &gt; highlight the connection with real systems analysis and 
&gt; &gt; modeling. The
&gt; &gt; &gt; lack of a specific *language* for defining systems is a
&gt; &gt; &gt; definite drawback.)
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Now it is quite possibly that some of these limitations are
&gt; &gt; &gt; removed in 
&gt; &gt; &gt; subsequent chapters (indeed, skipping ahead, it appears that they 
&gt; &gt; &gt; are...). But this points to a problem with the spiral 
&gt; &gt; &gt; pedagogical style 
&gt; &gt; &gt; of this book (from a researcher's point of view, as opposed to a 
&gt; &gt; &gt; student)... one has to go look at the whole book to get an 
&gt; &gt; &gt; idea of their 
&gt; &gt; &gt; overall system, as opposed to say, a chapter, where the system is 
&gt; &gt; &gt; formally defined, its theoretical properties collected etc 
&gt; &gt; &gt; etc. Anyway, 
&gt; &gt; &gt; that is just to say that for me to understand their 
&gt; &gt; &gt; theoretical model is 
&gt; &gt; &gt; going to take some time. If anyone else has already 
&gt; worked out the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; answers to the questions above, I would be much obliged 
&gt; if they can 
&gt; &gt; &gt; enlighten me/us.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; To relate HCC to the terms introduced in this book, HCC is
&gt; &gt; actually a
&gt; &gt; &gt; *language* (built from a very few primitives) that can be used for
&gt; &gt; &gt; modular "multicomponent differential equation systems 
&gt; &gt; specifications"
&gt; &gt; &gt; (Chapter 7.6, page 169). However, HCC is built on logic and
&gt; &gt; &gt; constraints, 
&gt; &gt; &gt; rather than on "systems theory", so the mappings are not that 
&gt; &gt; &gt; clear (at 
&gt; &gt; &gt; least at first shot). A lot of the distinctions introduced in 
&gt; &gt; &gt; the book 
&gt; &gt; &gt; do not seem to be relevant in the case of HCC -- for 
&gt; &gt; instance,  input
&gt; &gt; &gt; and output are symmetric in HCC (both correspond to imposition of
&gt; &gt; &gt; constraints); there is no separation between internal and 
&gt; external 
&gt; &gt; &gt; transitions. HCC is already closed under parallel composition 
&gt; &gt; &gt; (conjunction), so there is no need for a distinction between 
&gt; &gt; &gt; "parallel 
&gt; &gt; &gt; DEVS" and "classical DEVS".  Systems can be "multicomponent" and 
&gt; &gt; &gt; "networked" -- this is just another way of saying that they 
&gt; &gt; &gt; are closed 
&gt; &gt; &gt; under parallel composition (that is, a parallel composition 
&gt; &gt; &gt; of systems 
&gt; &gt; &gt; is just another system, hence this operation can be iterated 
&gt; &gt; &gt; repeatedly 
&gt; &gt; &gt; to obtain a hierarchically defined system).
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I would be quite interested in whether the theory of this book can
&gt; &gt; &gt; usefully characterize the other sys biology systems currently 
&gt; &gt; &gt; being built.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; For the relevance of hybrid systems to systems biology, I
&gt; &gt; would still
&gt; &gt; &gt; recommend the three papers I cited in an earlier message
&gt; &gt; rather than
&gt; &gt; &gt; this book.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;time being I'll assume that Zeigler et al. have done a good
&gt; &gt; &gt; analysis of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the process of modelling &amp; simulation, and use what I've
&gt; &gt; &gt; learned from
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the book so far.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;To get back to your email, Ed, Zeigler et al. distinguish 3 types
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(formalisms) of dynamic model specification (as opposed to
&gt; &gt; &gt; e.g. object
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;modelling, in which there is no concept of time): the 
&gt; Discrete Time
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; This is a glaring bunder in the first five pages of this
&gt; &gt; &gt; book, which can 
&gt; &gt; &gt; do much harm to readers who may not know better. The 
&gt; whole area of 
&gt; &gt; &gt; synchronous programming is about computation with a built-in 
&gt; &gt; &gt; notion of 
&gt; &gt; &gt; time (discrete and continuous).
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(DTSS), Differential Equation (DESS), and Discrete Event
&gt; &gt; &gt; (DEVS) System
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Specifications. DESS includes ODE and PDE descriptions. DTSS
&gt; &gt; &gt; includes
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;things such as cellular automata (which are updated as a
&gt; &gt; whole in a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;unit 'time' step). I think (but I'm not entirely sure) that DEVS
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;includes stochastic models (in which possible state 
&gt; &gt; transitions have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;certain probabilities), but also threshold models (in
&gt; &gt; which a state
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;transition occurs when a certain parameter crosses a given
&gt; &gt; &gt; threshold).
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Have I understood this correctly?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;  DEVS at least as in Chpater 4 do not appear to include stochastic
&gt; &gt; &gt; models or "threshold" models.
