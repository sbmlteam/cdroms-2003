Specifying rate laws in SBML is not certainly not easy, the problem I've
found is that one is not permitted to define 'local' parameters without a
rate law. If we could then there wouldn't be any problem other than
indicating somewhere in the SBML file that this is a stochastic model (One
possibility is to put a tag on the reaction itself indicating what sort of
reaction it is, this would be a better solution because one day when we get
mixed mode simulators they will be able to easily partition the reactions up
in to stochastic and continuous). I think that the rate law itself for a
stochastic reaction should be empty (the software should derive the equation
- this is what I do), and the SBML need only supply the 'rate constant'.

Hi Andrew and others,

    Is there (should there be) a topic in the list of items in the Leval 3
discussion where we can talk more about the specifics of representing a
range of different types of models in SBML versions after 2? 

    In today's MDL telecon there was a lot of discussion of the specifics
of recognizing stochastic models represented in SBML.  I am already
representing flux balance models in SBML without the benefit of a simple
designation that this is not something susceptible to kinetic modeling.
Still, flux balance is similar enough to what SBML was originally intended
to handle that the only things I had to invent my own name space to
represent were lower and upper flux limits.  Already in level 2 it will
not be necessary to specify initialAmount values for every species, though
at the moment I still have fictitious values of 0 for all, since these are
not part of a flux balance model.

    Of course there are no kinetic equations in these models.  As of this
week's BioSketchPad SBML importing update I am able to read in my flux
balance models and get diagrams of them, thanks to helpful tips from
Jonathan Webb.  At the moment there are improvements needed to handle the
80 or so fluxes and 100 or so species in my most important fluxes only
model for E coli (never mind the full 600+ flux model), but a version with
just 3 fluxes that share some reactants and products came up fine and
could be readly manipulated.  To no one's surprise the modeling option in
BioSketchPad complained about not finding the kinetic info it needed, but
it is still a promising tool for making diagrams of our systems of fluxes. 

     I expect from reading today's announcement of the new MathSBML
version, that given it is built around the idea of producing systems of
differential equations for Mathematica from the SBML, it will not get far
when it finds no kinetic information provided.  My understanding of
today's stochastic model discussion was that a tool like MathSBML could be
a lot more dangerous reading a stochastic model in SBML, since it would
think it was finding the kinetic information it needed and not interpret
it correctly. I imagine stochastic models could be as readily diagrammed
in BioSketchPad as flux balance models, but it might try harder to no
great benefit to run its modeling features on them.

     And then there are relevant models that have nothing to do with
reactions in the first place, like the 4D chromosome model discussed in
the previous telecons.  I was asked two weeks ago to try to provide more
specific info about the data representation needs for this, beyond what is
given in our Sandbox uploaded description, but the two people who know the
most about this have been out of the office recently (one is in Italy, not
sure where the other is).  The submission talks about sets of XYZ
coordinates, not clear if this suggests a listOfAtoms structure or a
listOfNucleotides or a listOfAminoAcids structure, or all of the above and
more.  It also talks about a matrix of distances and special approaches
for determining them, not obviously a part of what should end up in the
SBML.  Then there are matrixes of lower bounds and upper bounds in terms
of spatial constaints.  To the extent these depend on the distances, maybe
all of the above need to be represented, not sure.  But there is
definitely not a reaction in sight, so any SBML reading tool that is
expecting to deal with reactions should give up long before making any
misleading interpretations. 

   It was previously suggested there be a high level model type
designation so that any reader would know right away whether the
model in question is one it can deal with.  At the moment only
4 model types have been mentioned, kinetic, stochastic, flux balance,
and spatial.  But there would well be more when all is said and
done, and there could be features considered typical of two different
sorts of models used in some sort of hybrid model, so it might make
more sense to build on Cliff's suggestion for terms like

&lt;feature compartments FALSE&gt;

     In any event, I think it would be useful at this meeting to
try to reach a consensus on how best to deal with a variety of
model types.

&gt; Dear all,
&gt; 
&gt; Below is a draft agenda for the SBML Forum meeting May
&gt; 11-12.  Please send us your priorities/comments/suggestions
&gt; ASAP and we'll fix the timetable.  If you wish to give a
&gt; short talk or announcement on some aspect of software for
&gt; systems biology, please also let us know.
&gt; 
&gt; Outline of agenda (not necessarily in the final order):
&gt; 
&gt; * Organization of SBML standard development
&gt; 
&gt; * Standard submission to OMG LSR
&gt; 
&gt; * Relationship with I3C
&gt; 
&gt; * Tutorials on libSBML and MathSBML parser libraries
&gt; 
&gt; * Next workshop arrangements
&gt; 
&gt; * SBML L2 
&gt;   	* agreement on final form
&gt; 	* best practices
&gt; 
&gt; * Plans for publishing an article on SBML L2
&gt; 
&gt; * SBML L3
&gt; 	model composition	
&gt; 	arrays
&gt; 	diagrams
&gt; 	parameter sets
&gt; 	feature sets
&gt; 	complex species	
&gt;  
&gt; We think that the agenda will have all the L3 development on
&gt; the 2nd day and all the other items on the first day.  Do
&gt; you want the L3 discussion to occur in parallel sessions?
&gt; Please let us know how we should prioritize the L3
&gt; discussions.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
