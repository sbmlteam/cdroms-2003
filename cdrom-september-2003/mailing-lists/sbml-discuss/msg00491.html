&gt;Hi Ed + others,
&gt;
&gt;I have a book in front of me called "Theory of Modeling and Simulation"
&gt;2nd ed., by Zeigler, Praehofer &amp; Kim. I remember listening to a talk on
&gt;E-cell (can't remember whether it was given by Takeshi), in which this
&gt;book was cited as the 'basis' for E-cell - is that so, Takeshi? It seems
&gt;to me that the theory presented in this book is just what we need for
&gt;our purposes, but since I'm by no means an expert in this area, there
&gt;may be competing theories. Does Vijay have an opinion on this? For the
&gt;
I have followed the book a little bit. This is certainly in the 
framework of "Hybrid Systems" that combine discrete and continuous 
system evolution. It should certainly be considered seriously.

I do not have an overall assessment of the work yet; the parts that I 
have seen (e.g. the definition of DEVS in Chapter 4) do not seem very 
encouraging. I dont think there are structural problems with their work 
-- its just that a lot of obvious material takes up a lot of pages 
(thats just a matter of opinion and taste). A number of critical issues 
have been glossed over (at least in Chapter 4) --- e.g. are infinite 
sequences of instantaneous transitions allowed? (Ah, I see this is 
convered in Chapter 6.2.3, p 141). Why are DEVS not required to be 
effectively given ...e.g. the state transition function is defined over 
an uncountable set!?  What happens when an external event occurs at the 
very same time as an internal transition (ah -- I see.. on page 90 they 
introduce a "confluent" transition to handle this problem..this is 
messy!!)?  Why does the system output a value only when it undergoes an 
internal transition? Combined with the possibility that there can be an 
infinite sequence of instantaneous transitions, we have the possibility 
of infinite instantaneous output!?! Why are there no continuously 
changing state variables -- e.g. as defined by differential 
equations?(Ah, looking ahead I see this shows up in Chapter  In fact 
this implies that there is no notion of transitions because of state 
variables reaching a threshold!  Why does the coupling version (P 86) 
not allow feedback loops? The coupled definition is just plain messy 
(and also sloppy! Where is X_p defined? is p a port? How is X_p related 
to X_d?) Where is the semantics of the select function defined? The 
distinction between the parallel and non-parallel version seems just 
plain messy.

(The book does not appear to have been proof-read well. Chapter 6 is 
missing the bibliography ("Sources") even though it has citations. 
Another definite drawback of this book is a lack of realistic examples. 
Most examples are quite abstract and mathematical, instead of being 
drawn from concrete engineering experience, say, which would also 
highlight the connection with real systems analysis and modeling. The 
lack of a specific *language* for defining systems is a definite drawback.)

Now it is quite possibly that some of these limitations are removed in 
subsequent chapters (indeed, skipping ahead, it appears that they 
are...). But this points to a problem with the spiral pedagogical style 
of this book (from a researcher's point of view, as opposed to a 
student)... one has to go look at the whole book to get an idea of their 
overall system, as opposed to say, a chapter, where the system is 
formally defined, its theoretical properties collected etc etc. Anyway, 
that is just to say that for me to understand their theoretical model is 
going to take some time. If anyone else has already worked out the 
answers to the questions above, I would be much obliged if they can 
enlighten me/us.

To relate HCC to the terms introduced in this book, HCC is actually a 
*language* (built from a very few primitives) that can be used for 
modular "multicomponent differential equation systems specifications" 
(Chapter 7.6, page 169). However, HCC is built on logic and constraints, 
rather than on "systems theory", so the mappings are not that clear (at 
least at first shot). A lot of the distinctions introduced in the book 
do not seem to be relevant in the case of HCC -- for instance,  input 
and output are symmetric in HCC (both correspond to imposition of 
constraints); there is no separation between internal and external 
transitions. HCC is already closed under parallel composition 
(conjunction), so there is no need for a distinction between "parallel 
DEVS" and "classical DEVS".  Systems can be "multicomponent" and 
"networked" -- this is just another way of saying that they are closed 
under parallel composition (that is, a parallel composition of systems 
is just another system, hence this operation can be iterated repeatedly 
to obtain a hierarchically defined system).

I would be quite interested in whether the theory of this book can 
usefully characterize the other sys biology systems currently being built.

For the relevance of hybrid systems to systems biology, I would still 
recommend the three papers I cited in an earlier message rather than 
this book.

&gt;time being I'll assume that Zeigler et al. have done a good analysis of
&gt;the process of modelling &amp; simulation, and use what I've learned from
&gt;the book so far.
&gt;
&gt;To get back to your email, Ed, Zeigler et al. distinguish 3 types
&gt;(formalisms) of dynamic model specification (as opposed to e.g. object
&gt;modelling, in which there is no concept of time): the Discrete Time
&gt;
This is a glaring bunder in the first five pages of this book, which can 
do much harm to readers who may not know better. The whole area of 
synchronous programming is about computation with a built-in notion of 
time (discrete and continuous).

&gt;(DTSS), Differential Equation (DESS), and Discrete Event (DEVS) System
&gt;Specifications. DESS includes ODE and PDE descriptions. DTSS includes
&gt;things such as cellular automata (which are updated as a whole in a unit
&gt;'time' step). I think (but I'm not entirely sure) that DEVS includes
&gt;stochastic models (in which possible state transitions have certain
&gt;probabilities), but also threshold models (in which a state transition
&gt;occurs when a certain parameter crosses a given threshold). Have I
&gt;understood this correctly?
&gt;  
&gt;
 DEVS at least as in Chpater 4 do not appear to include stochastic 
models or "threshold" models.
