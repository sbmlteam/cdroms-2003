John,
        As most sites (if not most simulators) will just use one or two 
stylesheets for all their work, stylesheets won't be duplicated over and 
over again with the models. And the tool wouldn't have to *EVER* output 
the stylesheet.
        And you tool could "iggy" the foreign stylesheet in part or 
entirety, using it's native one if you preferred.

Mike,
We never dismiss your opinions as uninformed and meaningless.
Well, we do, but only behind your back. ;)
 
Seriously, though, Andrew's suggestion was worth thinking
about in detail, as you say. I guess I am having difficulty
seeing what the physical and logical parts are; it seems to
me the only logical part is the "graph layout", that is, the
nodes and edges. What the nodes look like, the colors and
fonts and borders and everything else, would be the
physical part, and the suggestion would be to handle all
that via stylesheets?
 
Also, with that approach, a tool would output an SBML file,
and an SBML-file-specific stylesheet as well. Right?
 
Also, when processing the SBML file, the importing tool
would still have to process the stylesheet-induced display
markup, yes?
 
If the answer to these two questions is "yes", then how is
that different than just sticking the physical description
inside the SBML file? I mean, we'd all still have to
agree on the allowed stylesheet markup, right?
 
John

                 People,
 
                 My $0.02 worth on the diagram support.
 
                 I think Eric Minch focused on a critical point, also 
echoed
                 by Andrew Finney and others, about the importance of
                 separating "logical" from "physical" representations of
                 diagram layouts.
 
                 While admittedly I have not implemented a diagramming 
tool
                 myself and thus some of you will dismiss my opinion as
                 uninformed and meaningless, I think that given the goal 
of
                 providing transportable diagram representations in SBML, 
the
                 best approach is separating the logical structure of the
                 diagram from physical rendering characteristics such as
                 shapes, fonts, colors, etc.
 
                 As Eric pointed out, this distinction has been addressed
                 before.  I think it would be wise to pay attention to the
                 lessons learned by others who have attempted to reach out
                 beyond their specific software tools &amp; implementations 
and
                 connect to other systems.  For example, the notion of
                 stylesheets, coming most recently from HTML, makes 
eminent
                 sense here.  It is a scalable and proven concept.  I 
think
                 Andrew had an excellent idea, which is to push off the
                 descriptions of physical characteristics to stylesheets.
 
                 There is an obvious downside to this approach for those 
who
                 have already implemented tools which use a physical
                 representation approach.  This is regretful.  On the 
other
                 hand, it is likely that no matter what approach is chosen
                 for SBML, every tool will need to be modified to some
                 extent, so perhaps the burden of change will not fall 
solely
                 on one group of developers.
 
                 As far as developing a logical representation for SBML, 
one
                 approach might be to survey a subset of existing systems 
and
                 find an intersection of common themes.  Herbert has 
written
                 up JDesigner's diagram annotations, and there are 
probably
                 descriptions of other systems, or at least their 
developers
                 (the members of the DWG) could probably write brief
                 summaries fairly easily.  By following Andrew's proposed
                 procedure and using this survey as a starting point for
                 defining the minimal graph information, it seems to me 
the
                 DWG could make fairly rapid progress.
 
                 MH
