Okay, now I see why IDs shouldn't be put into SBase. :)
I'm actually in favor of it, too, but I'm betting a significant
number of others won't be. So...
 
I guess minimally, for diagrams we could use ID fields in
SpeciesReference, ModifierSpeciesReference and, possibly,
KineticLaw. However, Unit already has name, and it is used
as a primary key, so it's a very good candidate for an ID
field--the only difference being that it must be unique across
the whole model. Also, models will probably benefit from
an ID field in the context of model composition (and from
being required as opposed to optional).
 
But, I see no reason at all for lists to have them (I didn't think
about these structures being subclassed from  SBase), and I
see no reason for &lt;unit&gt; or &lt;sbml&gt; elements to have them.
 
So maybe it would just be easier to go and stick them into
everything that *needs* them?
 
But, as I said, I actually lean toward sticking them into SBase.
 
John

	  JWagner&gt; I don't see why SID isn't put into SBase (the
	  JWagner&gt; primary key argument would imply it belongs
	  JWagner&gt; here). I say let's put it into SBase in Level 2.
	
	I'm actually in favor of this.  (I assume also that this
	would involve putting the 'name' field on SBase, since the
	'id' and 'name' fields go hand in hand.)
	
	However, before doing this, everyone should think about some
	of the implications:
	
	* The following substructures currently don't have ids or
	  names because they are subordinate to other structures
	  that *do* have ids.
	
	  - Unit
	  - AlgebraicRule, AssignmentRule, RateRule
	  - SpeciesReference, ModifierSpeciesReference
	  - KineticLaw
	  - EventAssignment
	
	  Remember that ids have to be unique across the whole
	  model.  Under this proposed change to SBML, even unit
	  definitions would have to have unique id's like this:
	
	   &lt;listOfUnitDefinitions id="u1"&gt;
	       &lt;unitDefinition id="mmls"&gt;
	           &lt;listOfUnits id="u2"&gt;
	               &lt;unit id="u3" kind="mole"   scale="-3"/&gt;
	               &lt;unit id="u4" kind="litre"  exponent="-1"/&gt;
	               &lt;unit id="u5" kind="second" exponent="-1"/&gt;
	           &lt;/listOfUnits&gt;
	       &lt;/unitDefinition&gt;
	   &lt;/listOfUnitDefinitions&gt;
	  
	  Note the added id's on listOfUnitDefinitions, listOfUnits,
	  and the &lt;unit...&gt; elements.  The point in particular is
	  that nothing can refer to the &lt;unit ...&gt; elements, but
	  this change to SBML would force software to generate the
	  id's in some way.  Same for Rules, KineticLaw, etc.
	  Further, it will bloat a model definition with more
	  identifiers that have to be hashed and processed.
	
	
	* If SBase included SId, then the listOf___s would also gain
	  id and name fields.  But these correspond to array
	  containers.  It seems strange to give ids and names to
	  array containers.  (Admittedly, though, this has already
	  happened with 'notes', 'annotation' and 'metaid'.)
	
	
	* It is currently the case that SId is a required field in
	  all places where is used, *except* on the Model structure,
	  where it is only an optional field.  (The reason is simply
	  that there's no construct within a model that can refer to
	  the model's id, unlike the ids of species and other
	  components.)  If SBase adopts SId, it would need 'id' to
	  be required everywhere, including Model.
	
	
	* The top-level Sbml structure (which defines the &lt;sbml ...&gt;
	  tag) is currently also derived from SBase.  Under this
	  proposal, it too would require an id, unless an exception
	  were made.
	
	
	There may be other interactions that haven't come to mind.
