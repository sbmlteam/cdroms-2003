I've come in late to this discussion so I might have misinterpreted what is
being suggested. 

I agree with Maria, concentrations have been used in reaction rate
expressions for at least the last 100 years so I don't see why we should
change that and specify that species in SBML rate laws should be amounts
rather than concentrations. It just adds yet another layer of complexity of
SBML, L2 is complex enough as it is.

In theory, it is SAFEST to express molecular species in moles (i.e. as
numbers). HOWEVER, second order rate constants and equilibrium
dissociation constants and Michaelis constants are normally expressed in
units of concentration (and time). In an equation such as the much used
S/(K + S) (S = species, K = eq diss const), K and S must both be
concentrations because of the way K is defined. Similarly, in dC/dt =
k.A.B, where k is a 2nd order rate constant, at least one of the species
A and B must be a concentration, and if the rate is a concentration over
time, both must be concentrations. 
Therefore, in practice it is SENSIBLE to use concentration units by
default, particularly in SBML L2, since it it built, as it were, on
enzyme kinetics conventions. The fact that you can have intialAmount or
initialConcentration confuses the issue, but as long as it is spelled
out clearly and makes people happy, it may not matter too much. Tools
that deal with transport between compartments, or in which there is
another source of possible confusion, should be very rigorous in dealing
with units, and communicate potential pitfalls very clearly to their
users. But this is not the job of SBML.

In SBML L3 this whole discussion will move to the parameter sets set,
won't it?

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Folks
&gt; 
&gt; IMHO I think we interpreted the intention of the community 
&gt; correctly.  L1 and all the L2 drafts have used concentration 
&gt; as the units for species in expressions.  I don't recall any 
&gt; mention of any concensus for change to this either on 
&gt; sbml-discuss or at the meeting at Florida.
&gt; 
&gt; This seems reasonable as must rate lwas are specified in 
&gt; terms of concentration variables.
&gt; 
&gt; Further clarification:
&gt; 
&gt; The way the specification is written at the moment is
&gt; as Mike has written.  Please don't try to interpret
&gt; this until you have read and commented on Mike's email first.
&gt; 
&gt; The following are additional details:
&gt; 
&gt; - species initial value can be specified
&gt; 	as substance or concentration (by using the initialAmont
&gt; 	or initialConcentration attributes respectively)
&gt; 
&gt; 	However species symbols in forumlae ALWAYS
&gt; 	have concentration units unless the spatial
&gt; 	dimensions of the containing compartment
&gt; 	is 0 in which case the species symbol
&gt; 	has substance units.
&gt; 
&gt; 	The initialConcentration attribute can't be used
&gt; 	if the spatial dimensions of the species' compartment is 0.
&gt; 
&gt; - the specific units of species symbols in formulae depend on
&gt; 	the units specified on the species structure,
&gt; 	the spatial dimensions of the compartment and
&gt; 	the units of the compartment.
&gt; 
&gt; 	The units specified for a species symbol are those
&gt; 	specified on the species structure if the initial
&gt; 	value was specified using initialConcentration (or if
&gt; 	the spatial dimensions of the compartment is 0)
&gt; 
&gt; 	The units specified for a species symbol are those
&gt; 	specified on the species structure combined with those
&gt; 	specified on the compartment structure if the inital value
&gt; 	was specified using initialAmount and the spatial dimensions
&gt; 	of the compartment is not 0.
&gt; 
&gt; 	The units used on species must be appropriate to the
&gt; 	to initial value attribute used and to the spatial dimensions
&gt; 	of the compartment.
&gt; 
&gt; Please comment on the above.
&gt; 
&gt; Specifically do you think having spatial dimensions of 0 is 
&gt; appropriate/useful?

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; People,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I confess I've become confused over what people want to see 
&gt; as far as 
&gt; &gt; species units.  After rereading the many messages about this on 
&gt; &gt; sbml-discuss, and comparing this to what we just wrote in 
&gt; the L2 final 
&gt; &gt; draft spec, it's no longer clear to me how people want to interpret 
&gt; &gt; the appearance of a species symbol in a math expression.  
&gt; Should it be 
&gt; &gt; a number in units of substance, or in units of concentration?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Note that this is separate from the question of what the
&gt; &gt; initial value for a species should be (people want the option 
&gt; &gt; of using either concentration or substance) and also the 
&gt; &gt; question of what the reaction rate expression should be 
&gt; &gt; (people want substance/time, not concentration/time).  I 
&gt; &gt; think those questions are settled at this point.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; In the spec as written, we wrote that species identifiers in
&gt; &gt; math expressions stand for the quantity of that species in 
&gt; &gt; terms of CONCENTRATION units.  However, Joerg Weimar's recent 
&gt; &gt; feedback, and a number of past messages on sbml-discuss, make 
&gt; &gt; it seem that perhaps it should be in SUBSTANCE units.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Using substance units would appear to be more consistent
&gt; &gt; with having reaction rates be in terms of substance/time.
&gt; &gt; One could generate concentrations by dividing species by the
&gt; &gt; compartments in which they're located.  So if one has two 
&gt; &gt; reactions, A -&gt; B + C and B -&gt; D, with the former having a 
&gt; &gt; rate of "k1*A" and the latter "k2*B" (where "A" and "B" 
&gt; &gt; represent substance amounts), and each species is located in 
&gt; &gt; separate compartments with volumes Va, Vb, Vc, and Vd, then 
&gt; &gt; the rate of change in amount of B would be
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;    dB/dt = k1*A - k2*B
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; and the rate of change of concentration in B would be
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;    d[B]/dt = k1*A/Va - k2*B/Vb
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Is that right?  Does that work for more complicated cases?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I'm sorry to bring this up.  I hope this is a simple
&gt; &gt; question and people can just tell me it's obvious that we're
&gt; &gt; going one way or the other.
