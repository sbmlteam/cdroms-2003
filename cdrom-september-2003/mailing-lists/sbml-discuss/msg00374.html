      Aplogies for not contributing to any of these discussions sooner,
but I have been at other meetings or on trips since the end of the DARPA
PI meeting.

&gt; &gt; Instead, I think the intention of the model needs to somehow be stated

&gt; YES!!! This is what I've been arguing for all along. What we want is a
&gt; flexible way for modelers to express their model information. But we ALSO
&gt; need to let the modelers explicitly express what the model "type" is,
&gt; with the consequence that inapropriate simulators will bail out
&gt; immediately. This also helps to resolve some of the issues that come up,
&gt; such as the peculiarity of a floating numerator and integer denominator.
&gt; If you look at as undiferentiated model types with a "one size fits all"
&gt; syntax, you probably see this as bizarre and redundanat. But if you look
&gt; at it as available fields where the model type further constrains
&gt; available usage, its not so bad. Because one "type" of model could require
&gt; the numerator and denominator to be integer, and another "type" of model
&gt; could require the numerator be integer or float and ignore the denominator.

      Yes, I completely agree with the notion that a particular model
should be able to declare its type (with sufficient flexibility that
anticipated and unanticipated classes of hybrid models can be
accommodated).  It makes little sense for a kinetic simulator to try to do
anything with a a pure flux balance model like ours where flux limits are
supplied but there is no sign of substance amounts or rate equations. 

       However, we do not perceive the stoichiometries as differing in any
significant way from stoichiometries found in chemical reactions in other
types of models.  Even in a kinetic model, I could imagine someone trying
to represent a biomass production reaction with empirically determined
noninteger stoichiometries.  Many, most even, of the fluxes in our model
are the same metabolic reactions with the same stoichiometries as found in
kinetic models of the same metabolic system.  The difference is we supply
flux limits and do not specify rate equations or substance concentrations. 
But the stoichimetries are unchanged, so calling them something else in
the flux balance model is completely missing the point. 

       For the stoichimetry question in the survey I was all for allowing
the originally specified noninteger stoichimetries in the few flux
representations where these are found.  At the same time I would just as
soon not lose the denominator option now that I went to the trouble of
adapting my SBML2 generator to produce denominators instead of noninteger
stoichiometries.  Also, it is easy to imagine wishing to represent a
stoichiometry like 2/3 precisely rather than approximating it with a
decimal representation.  I gather that a stochastic modelling application
might interpret the numerator/denominator representation very differently
from the approximate decimal notation, but this will not be a problem if
it can tell this is a flux balance model not likely well suited to a
stochastic modelling application in the first place from the model type
declared at the outset.
