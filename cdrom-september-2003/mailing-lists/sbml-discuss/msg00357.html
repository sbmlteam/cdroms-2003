  JWagner&gt; Just to get some feedback...those of you who do
  JWagner&gt; *not* have (separate) namespaces, how do you
  JWagner&gt; mangle/convert the local parameters in
  JWagner&gt; KineticLaw? I guess one obvious approach is to
  JWagner&gt; blindly throw them into the global namespace and
  JWagner&gt; ignore the consequences, and another is to check
  JWagner&gt; to see if throwing them in the global namespace
  JWagner&gt; would result in a collision and tell the user
  JWagner&gt; "I'm sorry, Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that".  A
  JWagner&gt; "better" way might be to mangle the name,
  JWagner&gt; converting Reaction R's kinetic parameter V to,
  JWagner&gt; say, R_V (appending a number or something until
  JWagner&gt; it is unique with respect to the global
  JWagner&gt; namespace), but then you'd have to substitute the
  JWagner&gt; new name back into the KineticLaw's expression
  JWagner&gt; (not to mention that the user might be a little
  JWagner&gt; distressed to suddenly see his/her parameter name
  JWagner&gt; changed).
 
  JWagner&gt; I'm not asking because I want to change the spec,
  JWagner&gt; I'm asking because I am trying to implement this,
  JWagner&gt; and it's still a problem. Currently, I'm throwing
  JWagner&gt; them blindly into the global namespace (ugh!).

About 1.5 years ago, we had an internal (to sysbio-team)
discussion in an attempt to devise a set of rules for how a
software tool might perform translation of names.  The
scheme is not perfect, as subsequent internal discussions
revealed, but for whatever it's worth, here it is, along
with subsequent email exchanges about unresolved issues.  I
think the discussions are pertinent here, although this
message is going to be very long (sorry!).

Look for lines of '=' as dividers between the messages below.

I know Joerg Weimar mentioned having a translation scheme
as well, and I have no idea how this one compares to his.

=== message #1 =============================================

&gt; From: Michael Hucka &lt;mhucka@caltech.edu&gt;
&gt; Date: Tue, 26 Feb 2002 20:02:45 -0500
&gt; To: Systems Biology Workbench Development Team &lt;sysbio-team@cds.caltech.edu&gt;
&gt; Subject: Clarification of name mangling
&gt; 
&gt; Here's an attempt at spelling out in detail what I think
&gt; needs to happen when different kinds of simulators read and
&gt; write SBML.  I think this resolves the issues of name
&gt; mangling that we've discussed.  The exposition may not be
&gt; clear enough, so please help clarify this if it's still not
&gt; good enough.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Ground rule #1: An SBML input file/data stream must obey the
&gt; namespace rules described in section 3.4 of the level 1
&gt; spec.  These rules are as follows:
&gt; 
&gt;   1.i) All model-level component names (compartments,
&gt;   species, reactions, parameters, parameter rules, and
&gt;   units) reside in the same global namespace.  This means,
&gt;   for example, that a reaction and a specie definition
&gt;   cannot both have the same name.
&gt;   
&gt;   1.ii) Each reaction definition establishes a private local
&gt;   namespace for parameter names.  Within the definition of a
&gt;   given reaction, parameter names introduced in that
&gt;   reaction override (shadow) identical names in the global
&gt;   namespace.
&gt;   
&gt;   1.iii) Certain names in SBML Level 1 are reserved or
&gt;   otherwise have special meaning.  Table 2 in the spec lists
&gt;   these reserved names.  In order to prevent name
&gt;   collisions, these reserved names cannot be used as names
&gt;   for any component of a model.
&gt; 
&gt;   (Comment: The implication of these rules is that SBML
&gt;   employs local namespaces.  This choice was dictated in
&gt;   part by the desire to ensure that the introduction of
&gt;   submodels wouldn't require changing the namespace
&gt;   interpretation rules.)
&gt; 
&gt; Ground rule #2: It doesn't matter what a simulator does
&gt; internally.  If it writes out SBML, the names used in the
&gt; SBML output must obey SBML's namespace rules.
&gt; 
&gt;   Corollary 2.a: If Gepasi, Jarnac, or any other tool writes
&gt;   out SBML, the result is not "Gepasi SBML" or "Jarnac SBML"
&gt;   or anything else.  It is SBML.
&gt; 
&gt;   Corollary 2.b: A tool can assume that when it reads SBML,
&gt;   the input obeys SBML's namespace rules and not some
&gt;   modified version thereof.
&gt; 
&gt;   Corollary 2.c: If a tool has to modify model names
&gt;   internally for whatever reason, it should not write out
&gt;   the modified names in SBML.  It should remove any prefix
&gt;   or other modification that it uses for its internal needs.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; How does a tool read and write SBML given these rules?
&gt; There seem to be three cases to consider: 
&gt; 
&gt;   Case A: a tool uses exactly the same rules internally as
&gt;   those stated for SBML.
&gt; 
&gt;   Case B: a tool uses local namespaces internally even more
&gt;   extensively than SBML.
&gt; 
&gt;   Case C: a tool uses a global namespace internally.
&gt; 
&gt; Let's consider each case in turn:
&gt; 
&gt;   Case A is obviously an easy one: the tool does not need to
&gt;   do anything to model names when reading/writing SBML.
&gt; 
&gt;   Case B does not appear to be possible.  Reactions are the
&gt;   only thing in SBML that have local symbols (in the form of
&gt;   parameters inside reaction definitions).  I don't see
&gt;   another element in SBML that would somehow generate a
&gt;   name local to itself.  Therefore, this case reduces to A.
&gt; 
&gt;   Case C is the only one left.  Since SBML specifies the
&gt;   rules for names written into SBML, the onus on conforming
&gt;   to SBML is on the tools.  A tool using a global namespace
&gt;   internally must make internal accommodations to translate
&gt;   incoming SBML into a form that it can use, and then to
&gt;   translate its internal format into SBML-compliant form on
&gt;   output.  How can it do this?
&gt; 
&gt;     Subcase C.1: Let's say the tool is a package that
&gt;     provides a graphical user interface around internal
&gt;     representations of reactions, parameters, species, etc.
&gt;     The user of the tool never sees the internal structures
&gt;     because the user only sees what's presented by the tool
&gt;     in the user interface.  This tool therefore has complete
&gt;     control over how it records the names of entities
&gt;     defined in an SBML model, because it can decouple the
&gt;     presentation of names to the user from the
&gt;     representation of names internally.  Since the tool uses
&gt;     a global namespace, presumably the tool uses some sort
&gt;     of global symbol table internally, and all names go into
&gt;     this symbol table.  One approach to handling the SBML
&gt;     names internally would be to add an additional to the
&gt;     symbol entry for each name.  This slot could hold some
&gt;     additional piece of information, for example the name of
&gt;     the reaction where the parameter appears, or just a
&gt;     numerical index for the reaction.  If for some reason
&gt;     storing this additional piece of information is
&gt;     undesirable, the tool could use a simpler scheme of
&gt;     simply altering the names of parameters by internally
&gt;     prefixing them with a unique (to the tool) string of
&gt;     characters.  E.g., if the tool's name is "mytool", and
&gt;     if there is a reaction R1 with two parameters, a and b,
&gt;     and another reaction R2 with a different parameter a:
&gt; 
&gt;         __mytool__R1_a
&gt;         __mytool_R1__b
&gt;         __mytool_R2__a
&gt; 
&gt;     The prefix "__mytool_Rx__" should NOT be shown to the
&gt;     user.  It's simply how the tool would translate the
&gt;     user's input into an internal form.  Input dialog boxes,
&gt;     etc., would only show "a", "b", "c", and not the whole
&gt;     string.  Internally, the tool would take the input from
&gt;     the user and prefix each name with the prefix string,
&gt;     then use that internally.  When it came time to write
&gt;     out SBML, it would again strip off the prefix string
&gt;     from those symbols that had one.  The prefix string
&gt;     would NOT show up in the SBML output.  There is no
&gt;     possibility of name collisions in the SBML after
&gt;     stripping off such prefixes because SBML assumes names
&gt;     are local to reactions anyway.  Also, since the prefix
&gt;     string is unique to the tool, the tool can always
&gt;     recognize when a name has the prefix and when it does
&gt;     not.  Note that it is always possible to generate a
&gt;     unique prefix string.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     Subcase C.2: Let's say that the tool is a scripting tool
&gt;     that provides some functionality to read/write SBML.
&gt;     This functionality must be implemented as code written
&gt;     in the script language, and what it offers to the user
&gt;     is some set of new script-level commands.  E.g., the
&gt;     commands might be the equivalents of "define a new
&gt;     compartment", "define a reaction", "define a parameter
&gt;     on the reaction", "give me the value of such-and-such
&gt;     parameter on such-and-such reaction", etc.  This
&gt;     situation can be handled exactly the same as in Subcase
&gt;     C.1.  Here's why: the code implementing the
&gt;     functionality *is* the user interface in this situation.
&gt;     Therefore, this code can be designed to perform the same
&gt;     kinds of name-rewriting operations (internally, hidden
&gt;     from the user) as described for Subcase C.1 above.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     Subcase C.3: Let's say that the tool is a scripting tool
&gt;     and for some reason, the author of the tool does not
&gt;     wish to perform behind-the-scenes rewriting of names to
&gt;     shield the user from the issue.  The tool still must
&gt;     read SBML (=&gt; a model with names in local namespaces)
&gt;     and translate parameters inside reactions into some
&gt;     globally-unique form.  In this worst-case scenario, the
&gt;     tool can still use a sensible prefix, such as
&gt;     "__reactionname__parametername".  The user will see
&gt;     these names, and be annoyed that the tool's author did
&gt;     not chose to hide them as described in Subcase C.2, but
&gt;     they will be able to deal with it, because the names
&gt;     coming from an SBML model will be have been rendered
&gt;     unique by virtue of this name rewriting.  Now, since the
&gt;     tool is a global namespace tool, any new symbols that
&gt;     the user creates in the tool environment will already be
&gt;     unique by definition.  Therefore, when it comes time to
&gt;     write out a model in SBML form, the tool only needs to
&gt;     strip off the "_reactionname_" prefix (the opposite of
&gt;     what it does to incoming SBML models) from those symbols
&gt;     that have it, and leave other symbols alone.  This works
&gt;     because new names generated in the tool have to be
&gt;     unique by definition, and therefore, if they're left
&gt;     untouched when generating SBML, they can't result in
&gt;     name collisions in the resulting SBML.
&gt; 
&gt; As a final concrete example, let's look at two tools in
&gt; particular, Gepasi (local) and Jarnac (global), exchanging
&gt; some SBML.  Jarnac is an example of Subcase C.1: it's a
&gt; tool using a global namespace and it has a user interface
&gt; that can hide name manipulations.
&gt; 
&gt; Let's say we have a reaction named R1, in which there is a
&gt; parameter a in the original model, and then in the second
&gt; tool we create a new parameter b in the same reaction.  In
&gt; this situation, since Jarnac is the one using a global
&gt; namespace, it is the one that has to do something internally
&gt; to the names.  For the sake of discussion, let's say it
&gt; simply rewrites the names using a prefix of the form
&gt; "__jarnac_reactionname__".

&gt;  a       -&gt; SBML -&gt;  __jarnac_R1__a  Gepasi simply writes
&gt;                                      the symbol a in the 
&gt;                                      reaction to SBML
&gt;                                      straight out, because
&gt;                                      it's already using
&gt;                                      local namespace rules
&gt;                                      like SBML does.  Jarnac
&gt;                                      prefixes the name when
&gt;                                      it reads it in.  Jarnac
&gt;                                      doesn't show this to
&gt;                                      the user, though; in
&gt;                                      the user interface, the
&gt;                                      symbol is shown as "a"
&gt;                                      because Jarnac can
&gt;                                      strip off the prefix
&gt;                                      when it's showing the
&gt;                                      name to the user.
&gt; 
&gt;                      __jarnac_R1__b  User creates a new symbol.
&gt;                                      The user sees it as "a"
&gt;                                      in the user interface, but
&gt;                                      Jarnac internally calls
&gt;                                      it "__jarnac_R1__b".
&gt; 
&gt;  b      &lt;- SBML &lt;-   __jarnac_R1__b  Jarnac strips off the
&gt;                                      prefix when writing SBML
&gt;                                      and calls the symbol "b"
&gt;                                      in the reaction. 
&gt; 
&gt;  b      -&gt; SBML -&gt;   __jarnac_R1__b  The user does something
&gt;                                      in Gepasi, and writes a
&gt;                                      new SBML output.
&gt;                                      Jarnac reads it and
&gt;                                      again prefixes the
&gt;                                      parameter "b" in
&gt;                                      reaction R1 with the
&gt;                                      prefix "__jarnac_R1__b".
&gt;                                      It doesn't know it's the
&gt;                                      same reaction or model;
&gt;                                      it's simply following
&gt;                                      the same prefixing
&gt;                                      rules for every SBML
&gt;                                      input.
&gt;                      
&gt; Etc.
&gt; 
&gt; Does this cover all the cases, and does it work?

&gt; 
&gt; Mike
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
&gt; 
&gt; Some comments:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; a) I think you have glossed over an issues with respect
&gt; to Jarnac of any other tool using a global namespace.
&gt; Its not possible to neatly divide this global namespace
&gt; as you want: for example suppose we have an incoming model in
&gt; SBML with a global parameter 'a' and a local parameter
&gt; 'a' in reaction r.  we can mangle the name of the local
&gt; one to _mangle_r_a. That's fine.  But if the user
&gt; interface demangles it back to 'a' then the user can't
&gt; distinguish between the global and local parameters.
&gt; In short some form of mangling scheme has to be visible
&gt; to the user.
&gt; 
&gt; b) the user can create new global parameters what will
&gt; overlap with the name mangling scheme. e.g. the user
&gt; could create _mangle_r_b.  A tool is best recording which
&gt; parameters were imported as local parameters and should only
&gt; apply demangling to those parameters as required.
&gt; The demangler should check the scope of the parameter before
&gt; transforming it back to a local parameter (the previously
&gt; local parameter may have been used globally).
&gt; 
&gt; c) if you record whether a parameter is imported local or global
&gt; you can minimize the name mangling to only the names that clash
&gt; i.e. you're not using the name as a mechanism for recording 
&gt; whether the parameter is local or global.  In addition the
&gt; mangling can be made unobtrusive e.g. parameter a in reaction r =&gt; r_a
&gt; if r_a doesn't exist anywhere else.
&gt; 
&gt; d) comments on implementation:
&gt; 
&gt; We can consider the purely global form and the purely
&gt; local forms as restricted forms of SBML then... I suggest
&gt; we only focus, for the moment, on moving models from the
&gt; restricted forms to/from general SBML. IMHO A tool must
&gt; not try to go from its restricted form to the other
&gt; restricted form. e.g. Jarnac shouldn't output fully localized
&gt; SBML, it should just return a modified model back something
&gt; like its starting point.
&gt; 
&gt; We then have the following functions, which can either
&gt; ideally transform a NOM like structure or modify an SBML
&gt; stream: makeLocalParametersGlobal, unmakeLocalParametersGlobal,
&gt; makeGlobalParametersLocal, unmakeLocalParametersGlobal.
&gt; A given tool only implements/uses the appropriate make/unmake pair.
&gt; e.g. Jarnac implements makeLocalParametersGlobal and unmakeLocalParametersGlobal
&gt; 
&gt; There 3 scenarios for the implementation of this
&gt; in order of preference:
&gt; 
&gt; a) the importing tool implements the make, unmake function pair that it requires
&gt; and it records which parameters are local/global in a straight forward fashion.
&gt; 
&gt; b) the NOM implements the make* functions but in each case generates a table
&gt; (array of string) of the parameters that were made global or local depending
&gt; on the direction of the transformation.  The tool that calls one of these
&gt; functions stores the table and then later passes the table to the unmake*
&gt; function.  This minimizes the disruption to the module importing the SBML.
&gt; (as long as caller keeps the table the caller can import the transformed
&gt; SBML as XML or by accessing the NOM structures.)
&gt; 
&gt; c) the NOM implements the 4 functions but adds an XML annotation to the SBML stream 
&gt; that labels parameters as local or global depending on the transformation.
&gt; Tools would have to preserve the annotation on import and export.  This sucks
&gt; because its complex.
&gt; 
&gt; d) the NOM implements the 4 functions without any annotation
&gt; scheme or table.  In this case the NOM uses an mangling scheme to record whether
&gt; a parameter  was or was not global or local.  This mechanism sucks
&gt; because the user sees mangled names that don't strictly have to be mangled.
&gt; 
&gt; The advantage of a, b and c, is that name mangling can be minimized or
&gt; eliminated depending on the original SBML model i.e. you only mangle
&gt; to eliminate name clashes.  c and d suck so much I would be against their
&gt; implementation.
&gt; 
&gt; I can advise in detail on the algorithms for these various scenarios
&gt; but you did a good first stab and I don't want to bore you now.

&gt; Subject: RE: [sysbio-team] Clarification of name mangling
&gt; 
&gt; Let's take the issues from easiest to hardest (so these are
&gt; out of order):
&gt; 
&gt;   afinney&gt; c) if you record whether a parameter is imported
&gt;   afinney&gt;    local or global
&gt;   afinney&gt; you can minimize the name mangling to only the
&gt;   afinney&gt; names that clash i.e. you're not using the name
&gt;   afinney&gt; as a mechanism for recording whether the
&gt;   afinney&gt; parameter is local or global.  In addition the
&gt;   afinney&gt; mangling can be made unobtrusive e.g. parameter a
&gt;   afinney&gt; in reaction r =&gt; r_a if r_a doesn't exist
&gt;   afinney&gt; anywhere else.
&gt; 
&gt; This sounds reasonable.  Probably a tool should do this in
&gt; practice, instead of always mangling everything.
&gt; 
&gt;   afinney&gt; b) the user can create new global parameters what
&gt;   afinney&gt;    will
&gt;   afinney&gt; overlap with the name mangling scheme. e.g. the
&gt;   afinney&gt; user could create _mangle_r_b.
&gt; 
&gt; No.  I submit to you that I can invent a name mangling
&gt; scheme that will not conflict with anything the user is ever
&gt; *likely* to use.  Admittedly the key word is "likely".  Yes,
&gt; if the user has infinite time and the desire to repeatedly
&gt; test alternatives, and run an exhaustive search algorithm
&gt; adapted from a password cracking tool, then they may hit on
&gt; the particular prefix string used by a simulator.  But this
&gt; is unlikely.  If the string is chosen wisely, there won't be
&gt; conflicts in practice.
&gt; 
&gt; So I believe this is a non-issue.
&gt; 
&gt;   afinney&gt; a) I think you have glossed over an issues with
&gt;   afinney&gt;    respect
&gt;   afinney&gt; to Jarnac of any other tool using a global
&gt;   afinney&gt; namespace.  Its not possible to neatly divide
&gt;   afinney&gt; this global namespace as you want: for example
&gt;   afinney&gt; suppose we have an incoming model in SBML with a
&gt;   afinney&gt; global parameter 'a' and a local parameter 'a' in
&gt;   afinney&gt; reaction r.  we can mangle the name of the local
&gt;   afinney&gt; one to _mangle_r_a. That's fine.  But if the user
&gt;   afinney&gt; interface demangles it back to 'a' then the user
&gt;   afinney&gt; can't distinguish between the global and local
&gt;   afinney&gt; parameters.  In short some form of mangling
&gt;   afinney&gt; scheme has to be visible to the user.
&gt; 
&gt; Ah, yes, you're right; I didn't think about this.
&gt; 
&gt; In this case, since the tool knows that it's encountered a
&gt; conflict from trying to adapt an incoming SBML model, it's
&gt; probably going to have to tell the user about it.  It could,
&gt; for example, bring up a dialog box and offer the user
&gt; multiple alternatives for how to rename/mangling the
&gt; variables.  Or it could just prefix the internal parameters
&gt; with the name of the reaction.
&gt; 
&gt;   afinney&gt; d) comments on implementation:
&gt; 
&gt;   afinney&gt; We can consider the purely global form and the
&gt;   afinney&gt; purely local forms as restricted forms of SBML
&gt;   afinney&gt; then... I suggest we only focus, for the moment,
&gt;   afinney&gt; on moving models from the restricted forms
&gt;   afinney&gt; to/from general SBML. IMHO A tool must not try to
&gt;   afinney&gt; go from its restricted form to the other
&gt;   afinney&gt; restricted form. e.g. Jarnac shouldn't output
&gt;   afinney&gt; fully localized SBML, it should just return a
&gt;   afinney&gt; modified model back something like its starting
&gt;   afinney&gt; point.
&gt; 
&gt; Right, I think that makes sense in the context of ground
&gt; rule #2.
&gt; 
&gt;   afinney&gt; We then have the following functions, which can
&gt;   afinney&gt; either ideally transform a NOM like structure or
&gt;   afinney&gt; modify an SBML stream: makeLocalParametersGlobal,
&gt;   afinney&gt; unmakeLocalParametersGlobal,
&gt;   afinney&gt; makeGlobalParametersLocal,
&gt;   afinney&gt; unmakeLocalParametersGlobal.  A given tool only
&gt;   afinney&gt; implements/uses the appropriate make/unmake pair.
&gt;   afinney&gt; e.g. Jarnac implements makeLocalParametersGlobal
&gt;   afinney&gt; and unmakeLocalParametersGlobal
&gt; 
&gt; I'll have to think about the implementation notes some
&gt; more.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for the reply!
