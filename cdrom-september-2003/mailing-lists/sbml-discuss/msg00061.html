Many thanks for your interesting proposal.
I think it is a useful contribution to the development of SBML.
I have taken the liberty of forwarding it to the sbml-discuss
mailing list.

I particularly like the way in which the approach can be applied
to all elements in a generic fashion.

I agree with your comments of inclusion verses encapsulation.
I would add that composition of models implies a hierarchical structure.
Are you implying that composition should restricted to one level?

I'm a bit confused as to how you would compose 2 instances of the same
sub-model in your scheme.  Do you have an example?

I believe we need to work towards a model composition
standard with the following features:

a) Interfaces

I think we can use defined interfaces.  In fact in some contexts they
will be very useful
for example they will guide users to those elements that the sub-model
author
thought were appropriate places to link to other models. Interfaces
enable two sub-models
to be composed graphically without the whole of the sub-models being
visible.

A user can chose whether interfaces
should be respected or not.  I think we can do some useful link checking
without labels
e.g. making sure that elements of different types aren't linked e.g.
species to compartment
in addition parameter units can be checked e.g. block a volts parameter
being connected to a
moles parameter.  In fact this was a motivation behind units.

b) Alternative model 'implementations'

It would be very useful to have alternative submodel "implementations"
for the same subsystem.
Alternative sub-models can model at different levels of details and/or
use different math 
representations.

The main problem with this is providing a labeling mechanism that would
allow users
to select the set of sub-models that should be applied to a given tool.
This implies
a kind of ontology that's either public or private to just a given set
of models.

c) overloading

You wondered how we would resolve the attributes of linked elements.
There are 3 possible complementary mechanisms:

i) abstraction - allow some attributes to be undefined/missing
(typically this needs to be restricted
to just those elements on the interface of a model).  some attributes
are already optional in SBML.
A missing attribute value is then overloaded by a 'concrete' element
which has an attribute value.

ii) hierarchical overloading - an attribute value from a higher level
overloads a lower level attribute value.

iii) directed linking - label one end of a link as being an overloader
that supplies the attribute value.

On XPATH, XLINK et al

I'm currently considering the use of XSLT as a mechanism
for implementing parameter sets (simple mechanism for overloading
parameter values).
XSLT uses XPATH.

There are problems with XPATH and related standards IMHO, that we should
be aware of.
I'm interested in what other people think of using these standards.  I
have an open mind
at this stage.

The problems I see are:

a) XPATH can only refer to concrete XML structures.  Structures that are
inferred
by SBML - in the future - such as the inside of a specific model
instance can't be referred
to (if you allow any number of instances of the same sub-model).  I
guess it can be done by
a pair of XPATHs one to the instance and the other to inside the
sub-model.

b) these standards work fine if you use them in combination with the
'source' data structures.
You can apply them to DOM representations easily.  However you're
operating on your
own non-DOM representation you have write you're own parser - XPATH
isn't XML! :-(
Many developers prefer to parse direct to custom structures.  Are there
parsers for XPATH?

c) these standards can be unconstrained - for example you can write
references to ranges of elements 
in contexts where this is meaningless - this might require some
complexity for a
validator.  A custom format based on XML might well make this impossible
at the syntactic level.

I have an open mind on this mainly to avoid reinventing the wheel.

Thanks again for your contribution

yours

Andrew

&gt; All:
&gt; 
&gt; I've posted a proposal strategy for constructing models
&gt; out of components at the following URL:
&gt; 
  <A  HREF="http://bio.bbn.com/biospice/mdl/design/compose.html">http://bio.bbn.com/biospice/mdl/design/compose.html</A>

The document is not complete but I believe it provides enough
information to understand the basic character of what I am proposing.
Comments are solicited.

The executive summary is roughly to use facilities proposed by W3C as
part of XML to compose SBML models rather than inventing a
function-call-like syntax in the manner of CellML.
