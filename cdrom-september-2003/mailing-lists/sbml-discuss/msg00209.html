I agree with yoour comment about MathML.
The current array proposal maps SBML arrays to vectors and matrices
in MathML.  A symbol declared as an array outside MathML
can be used as the content of a &lt;ci&gt; element where the &lt;ci&gt;
element is a argument to an MathML vector operator.
SBML 1D arrays map to MathML vectors and SBML 2+D arrays
map to MathML matrices.  

Unfortunately this breaks down (or becomes fuzzy) since
matrices in MathML are strictly 2D.  The semantics of matrices
operators in MathML are not well defined for 3+D matrices.
You sensibly suggested
that we should overcome this by enclosing vectors inside vectors
to give a scheme that is compatible with MathML. 
In this representation each dimension (in declaration order) of an array
maps to
a vector where each element is either a number or another vector
representing the
next dimension of the array.
This scheme would avoid the need to define operators for use in MathML
although we might need to define a special operator to map between
a vector of vectors and a matrix.

One problem is that its not clear whether MathML really supports
vectors of vectors.  What do you think?

&gt; 
&gt; Dear all
&gt; 
&gt; One of the things that we should keep in mind is how such concepts as 
&gt; 'arrays' or other collections mesh in with the rest of the language 
&gt; components. Given that MathML is currently used to specify 
&gt; relationships between SBML variables, and given that MathML already 
&gt; defines a useful set of collections (vectors, matrices, sets, lists) 
&gt; that are well integrated with the rest of the MathML 
&gt; language, I would 
&gt; strongly suggest that careful consideration be given to using MathML 
&gt; collections as the model for SBML collections. I believe that a 
&gt; one-to-one correspondence between MathML and SBML collection 
&gt; constructs 
&gt; would greatly ease the meshing of collections in SBML.
&gt; 
&gt; As I mentioned in the Fort Lauderdale talk, these ideas may not be 
&gt; sensible to discuss in isolation from the more general notion of 
&gt; introducing typing or classing mechanisms into the language. But that 
&gt; is an even bigger problem to tackle...
&gt; 
&gt; Best wishes

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Andrew,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'd like to participate in the "Arrays" working group, although I 
&gt; &gt; would prefer it be called the "Collections" working group 
&gt; so as not to 
&gt; &gt; prejudge the answer to your question about whether they 
&gt; should allow 
&gt; &gt; Sets, Bags, OrderedCollections, Sorted Collections, 
&gt; Dictionaries, etc.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My own view, which is biased by my experience doing simulations in 
&gt; &gt; Smalltalk rather than C, is that Arrays improperly mix 
&gt; three separate
&gt; &gt; concepts: collections, indexing and iteration.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; - The Collection concept provides the ability to refer to a bunch
&gt; &gt; (i.e.,
&gt; &gt; collection) of elements as "one thing,"  typically when the program
&gt; &gt; needs to pass the whole bunch at once, e.g., as an argument, to some
&gt; &gt; function.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; - The indexing concept is about how to refer to a 
&gt; particular element. 
&gt; &gt; In many cases, especially when the collection contains 
&gt; elements that 
&gt; &gt; are distributed evenly in space or time, naming the elements with an
&gt; &gt; integer
&gt; &gt; is exactly what you want to do.  But when the natural 
&gt; organization of
&gt; &gt; the elements is not isomorphic to a one-dimensional 
&gt; physical axis with
&gt; &gt; evenly spaced elements, integers become cryptic and arbitrary names 
&gt; &gt; that
&gt; &gt; don't offer much modeling power.  So, for example, a Dictionary is a
&gt; &gt; collection in which names (or keys) other than integers can be used.
&gt; &gt; [note, the implementation of a dictionary is usually a relatively 
&gt; &gt; sparse
&gt; &gt; array in which the names are converted to indices by a hash 
&gt; function]
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; - The iteration concept is about the order in which a 
&gt; program wishes 
&gt; &gt; to access, store, or modify the elements, usually with the implicit 
&gt; &gt; understanding that all elements are to be dealt with.  For 
&gt; example, in 
&gt; &gt; an OrderedCollection, iteration is intended to start at the first 
&gt; &gt; element and proceed successively to the end (or sometimes backwards 
&gt; &gt; from last to first).  In a SortedCollection, the intent is to start 
&gt; &gt; with the smallest element (not smallest index) and proceed to the 
&gt; &gt; largest (again,
&gt; &gt; one may want to go backwards).  Other kinds of collection 
&gt; (e.g., Set or
&gt; &gt; Bag) explicitly ignore order, i.e., they explicitly assert that the
&gt; &gt; order of iteration is undefined or irrelevant.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; At the implementation level, when a simulation is running,  
&gt; arrays are 
&gt; &gt; almost always the implementation of choice.  SBML, however, 
&gt; is a model 
&gt; &gt; description language quite separate from the simulation.  
&gt; It seems to 
&gt; &gt; me that modelers might like to be able to make richer or 
&gt; more nuanced
&gt; &gt; statements about indexing and iteration than those allowed 
&gt; by Arrays.
&gt; &gt; They may want to index elements by names rather than 
&gt; integers.  They 
&gt; &gt; may
&gt; &gt; want to indicate that the order in which the elements 
&gt; appear in the XML
&gt; &gt; text is, or is not, important.  They may want to indicate that 
&gt; &gt; iteration
&gt; &gt; should proceed in a sort order, e.g., smallest to largest, 
&gt; however the
&gt; &gt; elements appear in the list of XML.  And so forth.  Thus, if SBML
&gt; &gt; allowed collection tags other than Array, the modeler could 
&gt; use them to
&gt; &gt; indicate to the consumer of the model whether the order of 
&gt; elements in
&gt; &gt; the list is important or not. If it allowed Dictionaries, 
&gt; one could use
&gt; &gt; /key and /value tags to name elements rather than referring to them 
&gt; &gt; with
&gt; &gt; some arbitrary integer.

&gt; &gt; Charter of the SBML Arrays Working Group
&gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Background
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; At the recent SBML forum meeting in Florida it was decided to setup 
&gt; &gt; working groups to develop proposals for incorporation into SBML. 
&gt; &gt; Several people at the meeting signed up to a working group 
&gt; to develop 
&gt; &gt; a proposal for arrays in SBML
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Mission Statement and Scope
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Definition of an extension to SBML to allow the 
&gt; construction of models 
&gt; &gt; from homogeneous collections of objects.  Attributes of 
&gt; these objects 
&gt; &gt; can vary systematically across these collections.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Any viable proposal must:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; - support a mechanism for describing the connections between array 
&gt; &gt; elements
&gt; &gt; - be compatible with other proposals in particular model composition
&gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; dynamic structures
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Main issues to resolve:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; - What objects can occur in these collections?
&gt; &gt; - What is the correct mechanism for defining collections?
&gt; &gt;              for example should we consider sets, bags etc as 
&gt; &gt; alternatives
&gt; &gt;              to arrays.
&gt; &gt; - Do we need syntactic sugar to simplify the use of or compress the 
&gt; &gt; encoding of arrays?
&gt; &gt; - Should a function for defining the sparseness of an array 
&gt; be dynamic
&gt; &gt;              (vary during simulation)?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Termination criterion:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;    Arrays is included into the SBML Level 3
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;    or
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;    The idea is considered as nonsense for Systems-Biology 
&gt; and dropped
&gt; &gt;    from the SBML Agenda
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;    Timeframe: I expect a working proposal and first reference
&gt; &gt;    implementations for the next SBML Forum Meeting in
&gt; &gt;    Nov 2003 S. Louis
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Deliverables:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;    - a Array proposal for incorporation into SBML L3
&gt; &gt;    - a reference implementation that can read and write the 
&gt; proposed 
&gt; &gt; standard including L2 in a
&gt; &gt;      useful software context
&gt; &gt;    - at least one published model encoded in the proposal
&gt; &gt;    - optional: a tool that can translate from the proposed standard 
&gt; &gt; including SBML L2 to
&gt; &gt;      unextended SBML L2.
