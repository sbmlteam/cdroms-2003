&gt;Hi Vijay,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Thank you for your excellent overview of the hybrid systems in computer science.
&gt;In computer science 'hybrid' usually means mixing continuous/discrete components.
&gt;This is undoubtedly the most important 'hybrid' among many possible 'hybrids' I suggested
&gt;in the previous messages.
&gt;
&gt;One serious cultural dissociation between 'computer science' and 'computational sciences'
&gt;has been that in computer science simulation usually means running discrete-event or
&gt;discrete-time (such as conventional cellular automata) systems or logic programming,
&gt;while in computational science it almost always means numerically 
&gt;solving differential equations.
&gt;
That is, if you ignore the work in the last ten years that I cited 
earlier...But yes, your basic point is valid, the interest in combining 
discrete and continuous systems stems from the early 90s (at least to my 
knowledge).

&gt;My impression is (though I'm not an expert) that CS people tend to prefer induction
&gt;to dynamic simulation.   For example, some people are using temporal logic and
&gt;collapsed automata to verify propositions on dynamic models.   (Of course some
&gt;like simulation, and some computational scientists prefer analytical solutions to
&gt;brute force computation. )
&gt;
Not quite sure where you are leading. Perhaps the point to make is that 
there is a lot of interest in computer science to using symbolic 
techniques for reasoning about programs, and not just "executing" them. 
Obviously, wherever applicable symbolic techniques (e.g. model-checking) 
can be very powerful and should be used.

&gt;As maria gave a good summary, Zeigler's discrete event simulation theory was
&gt;extended to include continuous phenomena into the discrete-event world view
&gt;in late 90's.   (Actually it was published in 2000.) A virtue of his framework, as
&gt;maria pointed out, is that he makes a clear distinction between model and simulator.
&gt;
Another remarkable point about Zeigler's book is the almost complete 
lack of references to the Hybrid Systems or synchronous programming work 
(there are a couple in Chapter 7) -- e.g. I couldn't find references to 
Alur, Henzinger, Dill, Sastry, Kohn, Nerode, Antsaklis, Berry, 
Halbwachs, Caspi....

(Almost) All programming language research has made a clear distinction 
between programs (syntax), their execution (operational semantics) and 
their meaning (denotational semantics) since the 60s. Logic, the basis 
of knowledge representation and modeling, has made a clear distinction 
between syntax and semantics at least since the days of Tarski.....

&gt;Another possible view, however, is to see simulation algorithms as indivisible
&gt;parts of the models.    Every simulation model reflects its modeler's understanding
&gt;of certain real phenomenon, and it can be thought that some part of the 'understanding'
&gt;is implicitly coded in the computational procedure, or the simulation algorithm.
&gt;The same model can produce completely different results when driven by different
&gt;algorithms, and as we better understand the nature of the phenomenon, we becomes
&gt;to be able to create more suitable algorithms, or just to choose more appropriate algorithms
&gt;correctly.
&gt;
&gt;I don't think these two views conflict.   These are just parallel understanding of the
&gt;same thing.
&gt;
I think they really conflict around inter-operability. If you want a 
notation that can be used for modeling, simulation, diagnosis, design -- 
you are perforce going to require a semantics for this notation 
independent of the particular reasoner you are using. Then you can 
establish theorems about whether your reasoner is sound or complete or 
has other properties attractive to the theoretician or to the user. 
Similarly, if your notation is useful, it is likely going to have 
multiple implementations done by different groups around the world using 
different techniques. Once again you are going to require a semantics 
("gold standard") independent of a particular implementation so the 
groups can agree that their different techniques yield the same result.

I would say that one of the important lessons of the last fifty years of 
research in computer science and languages is the need to separate out a 
mathematical description of the notation from an algorithmic description 
of the processing of that notation. This is not easy. (For instance, 
this is still very hard for notations, e.g. Java, that seek to combine 
imperative change with concurrency.) It forces a tremendous amount of 
discipline on the language designer which is almost always enormously 
beneficial to the designer and the users of the language. And it is 
usually the basis for the application of reasoning techniques (such as 
model-checking).

So I would strongly encourage you to think hard about the semantics of 
your language. The fundamental question to ask is:  Can a user of your 
notation understand whether  the particular program s/he is writing (in 
your notation) is "correct" for the situation at hand, independent of 
his/her knowledge of the details of your execution engine ("operational 
semantics")?

&gt;Recent versions E-Cell deeply reflects the latter view. Also, that is why I distinguished
&gt;'hybrid' and 'multi-algorithm' simulation frameworks in my previous message.   
&gt;By 'multi-algorithm' I mean to be able to have multiple components (sub-models) that
&gt;are sometimes specially designed for specific types of algorithms, and driven by 
&gt;these algorithms.   
&gt;
There is also a long and honorable tradition in reasoning to combine 
multiple inferencing engines (usually for multiple notations) into a 
single one, e.g. Nelson/Oppen (1979), Shostak (1984). (A good set of 
slides for this material may be found at 
<A  HREF="http://www.csl.sri.com/users/tiwari/slides/shostak.pdf">http://www.csl.sri.com/users/tiwari/slides/shostak.pdf</A> -- also has an 
annotated bibliography.)

&gt;I believe this is one of the most important abilities of cell biology simulators, and that is
&gt;not necessarily required for biochemical simulators.
&gt;For example, a model of gene expression in form of S-System or GMA canonical
&gt;differential equations, which is often solved by the special ESSYNS algorithm,
&gt;cannot be run with Gillespie algorithm.   Or, a fluid dynamics model of 
&gt;protoplasmic streaming  (which often involves solid-fluid interaction) described as a set of
&gt;navie-stokes equations cannot be simply ported to ODE solvers in an efficient form.
&gt;
Equally true for physical modeling -- indeed for the modeling of any 
complex phenomena, be it in the physical, biological or artificial 
worlds (e.g. financial, online...).

&gt;Models include algorithms.
&gt;
Sorry, I fundamentally disagree on this for the reasons cited above.

Though perhaps a point of agreement is that annotations to models may 
certainly include references to preferred or known execution engines 
that can be used with them. i.e. notes on the usage of the model. This 
"pragmatic" view is perhaps a way to bridge the "conceptual" gap.

&gt;Importance of the 'continuous/discrete hybrid' of course does not decreases
&gt;here.  Rather the multi-algorithm framework is-a hybrid (I mean it is a subclass),
&gt;and it is indispensable to elegantly design and implement it.
&gt;
Certainly the choice of the phrase "Hybrid Systems" to name the sub-area 
we are talking about is highly unfortunate: each of the words is widely 
applicable, as well as the combination. But given that this choice is 
made, I would recommend not fighting it, but looking for other technical 
names to name different concepts.

Best,
Vijay.
