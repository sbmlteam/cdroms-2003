Folks -- I think this discussion does belong to the main mailing list. I 
am cc'ing my response to the main list.

There are of course many notions of Hybrid. The issue of what is the 
mainline definition and what is not usually gets quite politicized. Let 
me say that there is a community of folks in Computer Science and 
Control Theory who have been around for about ten years and who call 
themselves the "Hybrid Systems" people.  The sixth workshop, for 
instance, was held this year in Europe.  See e.g. 
<A  HREF="http://www.stanford.edu/group/hscc2002/">http://www.stanford.edu/group/hscc2002/</A>

The notion of hybrid here is this. A core divide at the heart of 
computer science is continuous vs discrete. Traditionally, computer 
science has been about discrete phenomena --- Turing machines, graphs, 
lambda calculus, objects, discrete automata what have you. Think of them 
as discrete, countable data-structures with a notion of discrete change. 
The new state of the system obtained in "one step" is the same as the 
previous state with a finite number of "cells" modified. Traditonally 
logic (as in classical logic, intuitionistic logic, linear logic...) 
deals with such phenomena as well.

Whereas classical mathematics, as developed over centuries and applied 
to engineering and the analysis of physical phenomena is about 
continuous systems -- functions ove the reals (famously not countable!), 
with notions of "smooth change", e.g. epsilon-delta. Differential 
equations of various kinds -- algebraic, partial, ordinary, stochastic 
are the favored means of modeling.

Hybrid systems seek to combine this fundamental tension at the heart of 
computer science and logic. This area seeks to develop algorithms and 
techniques for representing and reasoning about systems that are best 
described as combining discrete and continuous change. Consider, for 
instance, systems that exist in a countable number of "phases", and are 
subject to continuous evolution in these phases. Transitions between 
these phases are instantaneous and discrete -- typically they are 
triggered when some continuous variables cross thresholds. Such systems 
arise very naturally in practice when you have "controlled" continuous 
phenomena -- otherwise continuously varying phenomena that is subject to 
discrete control laws that when triggered can fundamentally change the 
dynamics of the system (and hence the way this is modeled).

The relevance of hybrid systems to biology has been pointed out in a 
number of papers. The first was:

H Matsuno, A Doi, M Nagasaki and S Miyano "Hybrid petri net 
representations of gene regulatory networks", Pacfiic Symposium on 
Biocomputing, 5:333-349, 2000.

R Alur, C Belta, F Ivancic, V Kumar, M Mintz, G J Pappas, H Rubin and J 
Schung "Hybrid modeling and simulation of biomolecual networks" In 
Hyurid Systmes: Computation and Control, HSCC 2001, Rome Italy, pages 
19-32, Springer Verlag LNCS 2034, 2001.

A typical example is gene expression. Expression of a gene A may 
activate expression of another gene, whereas above a threshold it may 
suppress the gene.

A lucid account is given in the attached paper:

A Bockmayr and A Courtois "Using hybrid concurrent constraint 
programming to model dynamic biological systems", ICLP 2002.

This shows how various biological phenomena may be modeling as hybrid 
systems in HCC, the framework my colleagues and I have been developing 
for about seven years.

Best,
Vijay

&gt; Thanks again Kouichi for your insight.  It is very useful to define 
&gt; what it is that we mean by "hybrid" and whether or not that should 
&gt; effect the definition of a model.
&gt;
&gt; We have a system which we call "hybrid" as well.  I'm not sure by the 
&gt; definitions you give whether it falls into the mixed-mode or 
&gt; multi-algorithm category.
&gt;
&gt; We assign the reactions in the model to be simulated using either a 
&gt; continuous method (ode's) or to be handled stochastically by a 
&gt; gillespie/gibson approach.   These methods run simultaneously and are 
&gt; synchronized by some scheme.  We also handle what could be called 
&gt; events and even delay differential equations.  Issues involved here 
&gt; include synchronization of time steps as well as state variables.
&gt;
&gt; This assignment of reactions to "reaction engines" (that is the 
&gt; solution method) is done outside of sbml in our simulator's 
&gt; configuration file.  Thus the model remains portable.  Also this 
&gt; allows us to run various experiments by changing the set of reactions 
&gt; assigned to each method.
&gt;
&gt; Attached find a relatively recent version of a paper which we have 
&gt; submitted and revised for the journal Bioinformatics.

&gt; peace,
