Hello Martin,


I am definitely interested in participating in the COMP SIG.


&gt; - 'Submodels and Modules' or the story about defined Interfaces.
&gt;   This is of course a controversal point but:
&gt;   I would like to include both approaches. Whether the biologists will
&gt;   use this or not can not be answered from the view of a programmer.
&gt; 
&gt;   &lt;IMHO&gt; This is a question of software engineering: Large models are
&gt;   large software projects which will be tedious to maintain without 
&gt;   interfaces. But sofware engineering is learned by doing your own
&gt;   failures and experiencing the problems, not by lectures of geeks and 
&gt;   reading books &lt;/IMHO&gt;

Ok please let me repeat what I've been saying to push it into the ML archive.
I think this is the first time I say something on this topic on this ML, apart from
some unofficial communications.

First of all, this can be a bit too philosophical, but I want to recall biology is a science 
of exception.     Many biological works have their values in finding
and proposing certain biological phenomena that cannot be explained by existing
understandings.   I believe this will not change, at least, in this century.
Perhaps we could get something by firmly assuming the structure of the system
if the system is physical, or maybe biochemical, but it is definitely not the case for
cell biology.
Secondly, the cell is not a human-engineered system, although a major focus
of systems biology is to extract system structures from the living systems 
that is analogous to, and can be understood by, engineering discipline.
(When it comes to philosophy, Valera and Maturana defined a living entity as
 'a system without input and output'... anyways.)

Being more practical, I definitely agree with Martin that constructing non-trivial biological
model is a software engineering.   Actually I expect no major objection from people with 
software engineering background if I say we can learn many from Brooks, RUP,
and even XP.

I also agree that interface is indispensable to clean modeling, but I suspect benefit of
having explicit interface specie/reaction definitions in SBML.   
Because:

(1) Species (and Reactions) are already working as interfaces.   
      As far as I can imagine, sound practices of SBML can use elements inside Reaction
      or Rule if there are something that should be hidden.  
       (this might invoke flaming.. but I want to hear your opinions..)
      If the reaction scheme has some assumptions that hinder changing values of intermediate
      variables (species), then it can be encapsulated in the proposed 'reaction mechanism' 
      element.   (although I don't know the current status of the proposal)

(2) As long as Species represent molecular species, as I wrote above, there are always
      possibilities of branching by factors *external* to the sub-model.    (adding a new reaction,
      changing context)    Therefore to maximize reusability  of the model, every Species should
      be public.   And making public does not raise a problem if (1) can be agreed.

(3) Putting everything in public is not so dangerous, contrary to popular belief.
       If a programming language analogy is allowed here, SBML is more like a dynamically
       typed language, rather than static compiled languages such as C++.
       My experience with Python, in which basically everything is public, is not problematic
       at all even for relatively large software projects (say, ~10k lines), but 
       rather very productive.   Simpler the better.
       



&gt; - Finally `Hello, is there anybody out there ...':
&gt;   Which tools for Sysbio besides Promot support composition and how, 
&gt;   to which extent ...
&gt;   I would like to learn more about the different concepts we 
&gt;   should support in the proposal.


I don't know if this helps, because E-Cell &lt;-&gt; SBML converter (which is under development by 
takeshi) will involve significant ontological conversions (unfortunately), but 
here is a brief overview of the structure of the current version of E-Cell (E-Cell 3).   
It is slightly changed from the previous E-Cell 1, and most of the major changes
come from a need to conduct multi-algorithm, multi-timescale simulation.
For example, a model of discrete Gillespie-Gibson scheme with a micro-second timescale and
a Michaelis-Menten type of continuous differential equation model of which 
typical timescale is milli-second can compose a single model.   
(The object-model can be further simplified in future versions.)

It has three fundamental object classes, Variable, Process, and System.
Obviously Variable objects represent state variables, and a Process object represent
(either discrete or continuous) changes in values of the Variable objects.
(No Reaction or Substance, these can be viewed as subclasses of Process and Variable.
 I think it is rather standard object-scheme in generic simulators, such as in lower-level
 layers of ProMoT?  This change was necessary to make it a cell biology simulator, 
 rather than just a biochemical simulator.)

System class is a container of these three classes of objects.   A System can contain
other Systems, and the model can be hierarchical.  And of course, everything is public :)

System has three subclasses, LogicalSystem, VirtualSystem and CompartmentSystem.

CompartmentSystem obviously represent a compartment.   It has a volume value, and
a full set of the list of the three fundamental objects.
LogicalSystem also has the list of Variables, Processes, and sub-Systems, but does not
have a volume.  If volume is requested it returns a volume value of the super (including) 
system.   VirtualSystem has the list of Processes and sub-Systems, but shares the list of
Variables with its super-system in addition to volume.

In addition to the hierarchical structure constructed by System objects, each System 
and Process must belong to a 'Stepper' object.    A Stepper implements a specific
simulation algorithm with its own step sizing method.    A Stepper can be either
discrete or continuous.   If there are more than one Steppers in a model, discrete-event
scheduling is conducted, and integration errors in communications between 
continuous&lt;-&gt;discrete and continuous&lt;-&gt;continuous Steppers are controlled by
Hermite polynomial interpolants.  A Variable can be shared by multiple Steppers.
Preliminarily we found that a composite simulation of Gillespie and ODE sub-models
can show 100-1000 times better performance than traditional synchronous simulation
methods.    

More detailed description may be OT to this ML.    Please visit <A  HREF="http://ecell.sf.net">http://ecell.sf.net</A>.
A slightly more detailed documentation is available upon request.
