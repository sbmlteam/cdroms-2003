And the point we are trying to make is, if we specify
units and you simply ignore them, then what you will
have is coordinates and measures that are relative to
each other.
 
So you're happy having relative positioning, and we're
happy because we don't have to make an an arbitrary
decision about how big to make the initial diagram
(which might be useful, for example, if you wanted  to
make an unattended SBML printer).
 
No. They aren't absolutely necessary. They are, however,
very convenient.

	Maybe I am missing something here, but the point we are trying to make
	is that specifying units should not be necessary if all measures are
	given relative to each other. OK, I am going to try to explain it in a
	little more detail, maybe someone can tell me where I am wrong.
	Lets assume, we have an sbml file with layout information and the
	largest x and y values are 2000,1500 respectively. And we also have
	some species reference that has a bounding box of size 200x70. Now in
	the render information of this bounding box, a font is specified as
	being of size 36 (which is just a relative size, not an absolute one).
	Now I have a program that needs to render this on screen and I want
	this font to be a 12pt font on the screen.
	So the fontsize given as 36 would be equal to 12pt, this would mean
	that I just scale all the other values by 1/3, so on the screen my
	canvas would be 2000/3 x 1500/3 points and the bounding box of the
	species reference would be 200/3 x 70/3 point in size.
	Now if for any reason I would decide that 12pt is to small and I would
	rather have an 18pt font, I would not divide be 3, but by 2.
	The point is, I do not specify an absolute size for a font, but a size
	that is relative to the bounding box, so if I scale the whole diagram,
	the fonts scale (in theory) nicely as well. (Assuming, that you don't
	have to substitute fonts.)
	We actually don't have any problem with specifying some unit in the
	file, we just don't understand the necessity for it.
	I fear, that this explanation was not much better than the last one,
	but maybe someone can figure it out and tell me where I am wrong.

	&gt; I don';t quite understand the argument in 1). Because the dimensions
	&gt; have no
	&gt; units we have no idea how big the 200*50 node actually is, the user
	&gt; might
	&gt; have drawn is as 200 meters by 50 meters (unlikely!). The 10pt font
	&gt; size
	&gt; however has a physical size. I'm not sure how scaling can help because
	&gt; we
	&gt; don't know by how much to scale unless you are implying that the
	&gt; dimensions
	&gt; do have some units? The problem is we're mixing dimensionless units
	&gt; with
	&gt; units with real units, I can't think at the moment of any way to
	&gt; relate them
	&gt; with out making some assumption about the dimensionless units.
	&gt;
	&gt; In your example I don't understand the scaling from 200*50 to 100*25
	&gt; because
	&gt; the font is 20pt? It looks like you're dividing by 2 and multiplying
	&gt; by 10
	&gt; (in relation to the font size). The 20pt font is 20/72 inches high,
	&gt; however
	&gt; we have no idea how high a 200 unit node is?
	&gt; I'm missing something here I think, could you explain your approach a
	&gt; bit
	&gt; more.

	&gt;
	&gt; 1.) Units
	&gt;
	&gt; Maybe we miss some point but in our opinion it should not be necessary
	&gt; to specify units for diagrams. If all size constraints are specified
	&gt; relative to each other the diagram (including fonts) can be scaled to
	&gt; any resolution the user/application wants. Lets say we have a node as
	&gt; a text label, then we could specify the size of the node as being 200
	&gt; * 50 and the font being of size 20. Now, if we want to represent the
	&gt; text label with a 10pt font, this would mean that the node would have
	&gt; to be rescaled to have the size 100 * 25. If the application doesn't
	&gt; want the font to scale with the rest of the diagram, the render
	&gt; information for the font could e.g. include an attribute called
	&gt; "fixed".
	&gt;
	&gt;
	&gt; 2.) SVG as layout format
	&gt;
	&gt; When we first discussed creating a layout extension for SBML, we also
	&gt; looked at SVG in order to store the pathway diagram/graph (that was
	&gt; also a reason why we did not include a 3rd dimension in the first
	&gt; draft). Finally, we dropped this alternative mainly because of the
	&gt; following reason: SVG is a vector graphics format and not a graph
	&gt; format. SVG does not allow to specify relations between objects as
	&gt; would be needed e.g. by any (reaction) graph or network.
	&gt;
	&gt;
	&gt; 3.) Using SVG tags as render information
	&gt;
	&gt; Although the complete SVG would probably be an overkill, we agree that
	&gt; part of the SVG specification could be used as rendering
	&gt; information(elements like e.g. circles, defs,...). One point that
	&gt; should be considered is whether the individual SVG elements can easily
	&gt; be extended to port 3D information or if we want to limit ourselfs to
	&gt; 2D rendering information.
	&gt;
	&gt; 4.) MathML rendering
	&gt;
	&gt; There was the question whether there are any libraries that deal with
	&gt; rendering MathML. So far the only free widget that we found is a GTK
	&gt; widget(GtkMathView).
	&gt; The alternative would be to convert the MathML to LaTeX, run LaTex and
	&gt; convert the resulting DVI file to a bitmap file. For this there are
	&gt; free tools, but no libraries.
	&gt; For further tools see: <A  HREF="http://www.w3.org/Math/implementations.html">http://www.w3.org/Math/implementations.html</A>
