Many thanks for working on this proposal, I think yourselves
and the people contributing to the discussion are obviously making
good progress.

I'd like to second John's comments.

In short:

a) somethingGR is not a great name for elements

b) the 'role' attribute is really not graphical information
and should be placed on the species reference.  Ideally
the form and content of this attribute should be developed
as part of the controlled vocabularies work. 

c) the 'refRole' should be replaced by a 'speciesReference' attribute
which contains the identifier of the speciesReference (given by
a new field id field on species reference).

(b) and (c) can be implemented in 2 ways:

(i) as an annotation of SBML L2:
create an annotation on speciesReference (not specieReferenceGR) in the
SBML model.
This annotation has an 'id' field and a 'role' field.

example:

&lt;speciesReference species="s1"&gt;
	&lt;annotation&gt;
		&lt;graphics:speciesReference id="sr99" role="substrate"/&gt;
	&lt;/annotation&gt;
&lt;/speciesReference&gt;
...
&lt;graphics:speciesReferenceGraphic speciesReference="sr99"&gt;
...
&lt;/graphics:speciesReferenceGraphic&gt;

(ii)as a proposed form for L3 or L2 version 2:
make the whole of your proposal an integrated part of SBML including new
fields 'role' and 'id' on speciesReference.

example:

&lt;speciesReference species="s1" id="sr99" role="substrate"/&gt;
...
&lt;speciesReferenceGraphic speciesReference="sr99"&gt;
...
&lt;/speciesReferenceGraphic&gt;

yours

&gt; hello,
&gt;

&gt; &gt; 0. With a few exceptions, SBML does not use abbreviations. 
&gt; &gt; Abbreviations are a Bad Idea, because they rarely make 
&gt; sense to anyone 
&gt; &gt; but the person who thought them up in the first place. So, I would 
&gt; &gt; change the "GR" and "GRs" to something more intuitive; I 
&gt; like "Glyph" 
&gt; &gt; and "Glyphs". 1. In SBML, things like reactants and products, in 
&gt; &gt; referencing other things like species, use an attribute 
&gt; name that is 
&gt; &gt; specific to their context. For example, a speciesReference 
&gt; element has
&gt; &gt; a "species" attribute to refer to a species. The layout markup
&gt; &gt; should follow this approach. Specifically:
&gt; &gt; 	* &lt;compartmentGR id="cGR1" compartment="c1" ... /&gt;
&gt; &gt; 	* &lt;speciesGR id="sGR1" species="s1" ... /&gt;
&gt; &gt; 	* &lt;reactionGR id="rGR1" reaction="r1" ... /&gt;
&gt; &gt; 	* &lt;speciesReferenceGR id="sRGR1" speciesGR="sGR1" ... /&gt;
&gt; &gt; Consistency begets clarity, beauty, and all sorts of other
&gt; &gt; wonderful nouns.
&gt; 
&gt; Since our proposal is only a suggestion, certainly the names 
&gt; can be changed. 
&gt; Especially your second remark makes sense to me.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 2. The whole "role" stuff in speciesReferenceGR elements 
&gt; seems a bit 
&gt; &gt; vague and misplaced to me, and unless someone can explain how a 
&gt; &gt; graphical representation has a "role" in another graphical 
&gt; &gt; representation (as is suggested by their 
&gt; verbiage)--especially given 
&gt; &gt; roles like "product" or "substrate", which are chemical 
&gt; roles rather 
&gt; &gt; than visual, graphical representation roles--I would like 
&gt; to see this 
&gt; &gt; overhauled. That is, these are either visual entities, or they are 
&gt; &gt; chemistry. If they are visual entities, then the attribute 
&gt; names (and 
&gt; &gt; roles themselves) should be given names reflecting this. If 
&gt; they are 
&gt; &gt; chemistry, then they should be moved to model section; in 
&gt; that case, 
&gt; &gt; my initial reaction would be to make speciesReferenceGR elements
&gt; &gt; specifically reference the speciesReference that they are
&gt; &gt; visually representing, and then put the role info in the
&gt; &gt; speciesReference elements. IN ANY CASE, a lot of the "role"
&gt; &gt; stuff seems incredibly redundant and vague, and belongs
&gt; &gt; (and indeed, already exists) elsewhere.
&gt; 
&gt; Let me explain why we did it like this:
&gt; Our reaction glyph (as you would propably like to call it) 
&gt; consists basically 
&gt; of 2 nodes representing the points where the substrate arcs 
&gt; and the product 
&gt; arcs meet (additional information of how to connect these 2 
&gt; nodes could be 
&gt; added). Then the reaction glyph contains species reference 
&gt; glyphs (graphical 
&gt; representations of species references in our proposal). These species 
&gt; reference glyphs contain the information which species glyphs 
&gt; are connected 
&gt; to which node of the reaction glyph and how the arc looks 
&gt; like. The whole mess with the roles comes from the fact that 
&gt; we need to reference a 
&gt; specific species reference in the species reference glyph 
&gt; (Because if we want 
&gt; to have a graphical model editor it should be possible to 
&gt; click on an arc and 
&gt; then know which species reference it refers to). Since 
&gt; species references do 
&gt; not have an ID we refer to them by reaction, species, and 
&gt; role. And even that 
&gt; is still potentially ambiguous. So the first role ("refRole" 
&gt; in our proposal) 
&gt; is used to refer to a species reference in the model. The 
&gt; second role ("role" 
&gt; in our proposal) is used to tell a renderer with some 
&gt; biochemical knowhow how 
&gt; to render the connection between species glyph and the nodes 
&gt; of the reaction 
&gt; glyph. Propbably some renderers would draw a species 
&gt; reference glyph with 
&gt; "substrate" role as some arc connecting the species glyph to 
&gt; the substrate 
&gt; node of the reaction glyph. 
&gt; 
&gt; The reason why this two roles can differ was given in the 
&gt; discussion on this 
&gt; mailing list some time ago: Say we want to render a reaction 
&gt; A-&gt;B catalized 
&gt; by enzyme E (this reaction has three species references) as 
&gt; A+E-&gt;B+E (four 
&gt; species reference glyphs). In this case we have two species 
&gt; reference glyphs 
&gt; (with role "substrate" and "product") that refer to one 
&gt; species reference (a 
&gt; modifier species reference)
&gt; 
&gt; The underlying assumption for our proposal is of course that 
&gt; the layout 
&gt; description does not only focus on the graphics (in this case 
&gt; we should use a 
&gt; general graph description language) but on the biochemical 
&gt; structure of the 
&gt; layout. 
&gt; 
&gt; What we want to carry with a species reference glyph would be 
&gt; in English: "Species glyph x is connected to Reaction y as a 
&gt; substrate. The species 
&gt; reference it refers to is z. If you want to know more there 
&gt; is additional 
&gt; information on how to render the arc."
&gt; 
&gt; We do not want to carry information like: "There are nodes 
&gt; x,y,z, and they are 
&gt; connected by arcs a,b,c, and we have information how to 
&gt; render the arcs"
