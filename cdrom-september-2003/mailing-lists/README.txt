This folder contains archives of messages sent to the various SBML
mailing lists up to the time of creation of this CD-ROM (29 August 2003).
The archive is split into two subfolders:

  "sbml-discuss" contains an archive of messages sent to the
  sbml-discuss@caltech.edu mailing list since the creation of the list on
  30 August 2002.

  "pre-sbml-discuss" contains an archive of messages sent to the separate,
  topic-oriented mailing lists that existed prior to the formation of the
  single sbml-discuss@caltech.edu list on 30 August 2002.

Some history about this: The use of multiple separate mailing lists turned
out to be an unsuccessful experiment in SBML community organization, and
after some time, the SBML community adopted the single sbml-discuss list
that is now in existence.

sbml-discuss@caltech.edu is today the primary discussion forum for the SBML
community.
